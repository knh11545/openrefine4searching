AB  - Background and study aims
      Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 people. It is characterised by the development of tumours in many organs and can lead to seizures, neuro-cognitive difficulties and behavioural and developmental disorders. These brain-related problems occur in the majority of those with TSC and were rated as being the most significant part of the disease by patients and families because of their everyday impact on education, employment, family and social life. The potential benefits of better treatment therefore include both a reduction in health care demands and wider benefits for patients and their carers. In the past it was thought that many of the problems caused by TSC might be entirely due to tumours in the brains of sufferers. However, recent research suggests that not only might gene mutation also play a major role but it is also possibly reversible.   Studies have shown that certain drugs can be used to reduce the size of tumours. The main aim of this study is to see how the use of a drug named Everolimus affects recall memory and executive function of those with TSC over a period of 6 months.
      Who can participate?
      Participants need to be aged 16 to 60 years and have an IQ of more than 60. Both males and females can take part in the study. Only people with TSC will be able to take part.
      What does the study involve?
      Before starting, you will be asked to have some tests that help the doctor to decide if you can take part in the research. If the doctor thinks you can take part you will also be asked to come back to the hospital about every 2 weeks to begin with and then with longer gaps between visits as time goes on, for 9 months.  The tests you may have as part of this research include:
      1. The doctor will talk to you about how you feel.
      2. The doctor will examine you.
      3. You will have a test to find out how well your lungs work. 
      4. You will have a test to measure your heartbeat (Electrocardiogram (ECG)).
      5. The doctor or nurse will take a blood sample from you.
      6. You will be asked to provide a urine sample.
      7. The research psychologist will do some memory and thinking tests with you.
      In this research some people taking part will receive the medicine we are testing and other people will receive a 'dummy medicine' that looks exactly the same but does not contain any active ingredients. Neither you nor the research doctor can choose whether you will get the study medicine or the dummy medicine and you will not know which one you are taking throughout the study.
      You will be asked to take tablets (2 for most people, but this may vary) once a day by mouth at about the same time of day. 
      You may either take the tablets with a glass of water or apple juice or after a light meal. If you find this difficult you may instead dissolve the tablets in a glass of water and drink the mixture. If you have problems taking the medicine please tell the research doctor and the person who comes with you to the research clinic. 
      Whilst taking part in the research you will be asked to avoid grapefruit, Seville oranges (including marmalade), and star fruit and the juices of these fruits as they can cause problems with the medicine.  
      A drug called Everolimus will be compared against a placebo. One third of the participants will receive the placebo while two-thirds will receive the drug Everolimus but this is decided at random.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The potential benefits of taking part include both a reduction in health care demands and a reduction is the amount of neuro-cognitive difficulties experienced. Possible side effects of the medicine include mouth ulcers, feeling tired, weak and sick, being sick, skin rash, problems going to the toilet, not feeling very hungry, swelling in your legs, feeling hot, having an odd taste in your mouth, nose bleeds, pain in your arms and/or legs, shortness of breath, dry skin and headache. However, there will be a doctor will be able to help decide how best to deal with any side effect. 
      Where is the study run from?
      The study is open to people from all over the UK but it will take place at University Hospital Wales, Cardiff.
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?
      The study is due to start recruiting participants at the end of December 2011. The trial will be recruiting participants for 12 months. 
      Who is funding the study?
      The study is being run by Cardiff University but funded by pharmaceutical company Novartis.

UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10010669
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN10010669
AB  - Background and study aims
      Non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsq NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. It usually grows and spreads more slowly than small cell lung cancer.  Tiragolumab (formerly MTIG7192A) is a human antibody that is being studied as a potential therapy against various cancer types. An antibody is a protein in the blood that helps the body’s defences by identifying and attaching to specific foreign substances including germs. 
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects, good or bad, of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab in participants with nsq NSCLC.  
      Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab are experimental drugs, which means health authorities have yet not approved the combination for the treatment of nsq NSCLC.
      Who can participate?
      Participants aged 18 years and above with previously untreated, locally advanced nsq NSCLC that has grown or spread and cannot be removed by surgery.
      What does the study involve? 
      Participants will need to be a part of this study for about 3-5 years. This study will have three parts:
      1. A screening visit, wherein certain tests would be done to determine if the participant is eligible to take part in the study.
      2. The treatment period, when eligible participants will be given a single dose of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination into the vein (infusion) every 3 weeks for a cycle of 21 days on a regular basis unless their cancer condition worsens. Participants will have to visit the clinic about every 3 weeks while they are receiving treatment and each visit may last 6 to 72 hours.
      3. A follow-up period during which participants will have check-up visits every 3 months or more frequently till the end of the study. The participant will have to visit the clinic or will be contacted telephonically for the follow-up procedures.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participants will not receive any direct medical benefit, but the information gained from this study may help other people with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in the future. Participants will be paid renminbi (RMB) 100 as a transportation reimbursement for every clinic visit including the screening procedures.
      Participants may have side effects from the drugs or procedures used in this study. These can be mild to severe and even life-threatening, and they can vary from person to person.
      Tiragolumab has had limited testing in humans. Known potential side effects include fever, chills, shortness of breath, nausea, and changes in blood pressure. Participants may experience inflammation in the tumour but also in the healthy parts (normal tissue) of the body due to increased activity of the immune system. The affected parts of the body could be (but not limited to) the skin, eyes, nerves, gut, hormone system, kidneys, lungs, liver, muscles, blood vessels, and blood cells. Tiragolumab could also lower the number of certain white blood cells (lymphocytes).
      Very common side effects of atezolizumab include back pain, cough, decreased appetite, loose stools, fatigue, fever, headache, itching of the skin (pruritus), joint pain (arthralgia), lack of energy (asthenia), muscle and bone pain (myalgia, musculoskeletal pain and bone pain), nausea, rash, shortness of breath (dyspnea), urinary tract infection, vomiting
      Common side effects of atezolizumab include allergic reaction or intolerance to medication (hypersensitivity), chills, decreased level of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), decreased level of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia), decreased oxygen supply in the body resulting in shortness of breath (hypoxia), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), dry skin, flu-like illness, increased blood level of creatinine, a substance normally eliminated by the kidneys into the urine, increased blood sugar level (hyperglycemia), inflammation of the intestines (colitis), inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis), infusion-related reaction, low blood pressure (hypotension), a low platelet count in the blood, which may make you more likely to bruise or bleed (thrombocytopenia), mouth and throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), inflammation of the nose and throat (nasopharyngitis), stomach-area pain (abdominal pain), underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) 
      Less common side effects of atezolizumab include decreased production of hormones by the adrenal glands (adrenal insufficiency), diabetes mellitus, inflammation of the brain and membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningoencephalitis), inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), inflammation of the pituitary gland (hypophysitis), inflammation or damage of the muscles (myositis), nerve damage resulting in muscle weakness (myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis), nerve damage that may cause muscle weakness and/or paralysis (Guillain-Barré syndrome), overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), red, dry, scaly patches of thickened skin (psoriasis), severe high levels of sugar and acids in the blood or urine (diabetic ketoacidosis), severe skin or mucosal reactions (severe cutaneous adverse reactions)
      Very common serious side effects of bevacizumab include high blood pressure, numbness or loss of feeling in the fingers or toes, low numbers of white blood cells potentially associated with fever, low numbers of platelets, weakness, loss of energy, loose stools, with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 
      Very common non-serious side effects of bevacizumab include nausea and vomiting, pain, including headache and joint pain, constipation, mucosal inflammation or inflammation of the mouth, protein in the urine, bleeding in the moist lining of the digestive, respiratory, reproductive, or urinary tracts, loss of appetite, fever, runny nose, dry skin, flaking and inflammation of the skin, change in skin color, change in the sense of taste, problems with the eyes and tearing, cough.
      Common serious side effects of bevacizumab include infection, presence of bacteria in the blood, collection of pus in tissue or organs, a tear or hole in the gut, an abnormal tube-like connection between the gastrointestinal tract and skin or other tissues that are not normally connected, low number of red blood cells, bleeding, including bleeding associated with the tumour and nose bleeds, clogging of a vessel in the lung, blocking of the blood vessels (arteries) by a blood clot, including stroke or heart attack, heart failure, especially in participants who have taken certain chemotherapy, blood clots in the veins, abdominal pain, blockage in the intestine, body water loss, pain, tenderness, or blistering on the fingers or feet, reduced consciousness, sleepiness, feeling tired, fainting, allergic reaction, including allergic reaction to the drug during infusion, shortness of breath, low levels of oxygen in the blood, wound-healing problems. 
      Common non-serious side effects of bevacizumab include digestive system disorder, voice changes, hoarseness, muscular pain or muscular weakness.
      Less common serious side effects of bevacizumab include an abnormal connection between internal organs (other than the digestive tract) and skin or other tissues not normally connected.
      Other rare but potentially serious side effects of bevacizumab include reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, which may include symptoms of impaired brain function (headaches, vision changes, confusion, or fit [seizures]), and, often, high blood pressure, hypertensive encephalopathy, which may include symptoms of impaired brain function (headaches, vision changes, confusion, or fit [seizures]) and, often, high blood pressure.
      During tumour tissue sampling (biopsy) participants might experience pain, redness, swelling, excessive bleeding, bruising, or draining at the needle site.  Abnormal wound healing, fever, infection, and allergic reaction to the medication used to numb the skin over the biopsy site can also occur
      Blood sampling: Drawing blood can cause pain, bruising, or infection where the needle is inserted. Some participants might experience dizziness, fainting, or an upset stomach when their blood is drawn. 
      Tumour assessment scanning procedures including computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and Bone scan might include potential risks such as allergic reaction, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, headaches, hives, temporary low blood pressure, chest pain, back pain, fever, weakness, and seizures to a tracer or a contrast agent. Although there are no known long-term harmful effects from the radiation of a single scan, the risk of harmful effects from multiple scans over a period is not known.
      There may be a risk in exposing an unborn child to the study drug, and all risks are not known at this time. Women and men must take precautions to avoid exposing an unborn child to the study drug. Participants who are pregnant, become pregnant or are currently breastfeeding cannot take part in this study.

PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10516986
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN10516986
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Some people may be missing a facial part e.g. an eye or nose. This can be due to a number of reasons including trauma or surgery for head and neck cancer. This affects a patient’s appearance, function, and wellbeing. The missing part can be replaced with a bespoke removable silicone facial prosthesis. Patients attend multiple hospital visits so that highly trained healthcare staff can recreate the missing part. There is an ongoing patient and healthcare burden as prostheses are replaced every 6-24 months.
      The current standard of making facial prostheses has significant drawbacks. Patient and public involvement contributors selected three priority improvement areas: 
      1. Get rid of uncomfortable/painful facial moulds (impressions) used to make prostheses
      2. More closely match the way they looked before surgery
      3. Receive their prosthesis sooner after surgery 
      Digital technology could change the way prostheses are made. Facial scanning could offer a contactless and comfortable alternative to impressions, prostheses could be designed using computers to recreate the missing part, and the process could be made quicker using 3D printing technology.
      This feasibility study aims to assess the possibility of conducting a future full-scale trial that will compare patient preference, costs, and benefits of using digital technology to make facial prostheses compared with the current standard of care.
      Who can participate? 
      Adult patients across two NHS hospitals who require a replacement eye or nose facial prosthesis
      What does the study involve? 
      Each patient will receive two new prostheses which will be made at the same time (one made digitally and one made by current standards). Patients will not know how each prosthesis was made. Patients will be reviewed four weeks after receiving each prosthesis. They will be asked which prosthesis they prefer. Information will be collected on costs and benefits through surveys.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      Research like this helps to continually improve the treatments and care provided to patients. By taking part, it will help us to design a larger study that will find out if making prostheses by hand or using digital technology is better for patients and healthcare services. In addition, if the healthcare team is happy with the performance of both facial prostheses, participants will be able to keep both prostheses at the end of the study. There are no extra risks involved with having the prostheses made compared with normal care. Appointments may take longer than normal and participants will be asked to attend 2 additional review visits above normal care. Participants will be recompensed for reasonable direct travel expenses incurred during these 2 additional review visits (such as train fares or car parking) up to a limit as outlined in the Participant Information Sheet.

TI  - Can performing daily breathing exercises before major surgery reduce the risk of developing lung complications after surgery?
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10644366
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN10644366
AB  - Background and study aims
      Major operations in the stomach or chest provide life-saving operations for people with cancer or a heart condition.  As with all major surgery, there is a chance of developing complications after the operation. The Inspire study is concerned with lung complications, including pneumonia. Lung complications after surgery are common, affecting on average one in ten patients, although it depends on the current health of the person and the type of surgery they are having. Lung complications have a long term effect, and can reduce life expectancy for up to ten years after the operation. Poor health due to lung complications also increases healthcare costs. Consequently, trying to prevent lung complications is important for both patients and the NHS.
      The study aims to investigate whether breathing training reduces lung complications in patients who, because of their health or the operation they are having, have a higher than average risk of developing lung complications after surgery.  Some studies have shown that training for as little as two weeks before a major operation halves the risk of lung complications. The benefits of this training, however, remain uncertain as previous studies recruited too few patients and many were not done well.  
      Who can participate?
      Adult patients having operations in the chest or stomach under general anaesthesia.
      What does the study involve?
      The Inspire study is investigating whether a series of daily breathing exercises that aim to improve the strength and endurance of the muscles in the chest can help to reduce the chances of getting a lung complication after surgery. The exercises involve using a hand-held device held up to the mouth, through which the patient will breathe in and out. Training takes approximately 15 minutes twice a day and can be performed at home whilst sitting down. 
      To try to make sure the groups are the same to start with, each patient is put into a group randomly.  Each person taking part will have an equal chance of being in either group.  If a patient takes part in the research neither they, nor the surgeon, nor the research team will be able to choose which breathing technique they are given. 
      Groups 1 & 2: Breathing training with the hand-held device with resistance/difficulty differences: Patients will be taught how to use the device and perform the exercises and instructed to do the exercises twice a day (30 breaths each time, which will take approximately 15 minutes) for a
      minimum of 2 weeks. If the patients have a longer wait for surgery or their surgery date is rescheduled then they can continue doing the exercises until the day before their operation.
      Group 3: Breathing exercises without the hand-held device: Patients will be given an instruction leaflet with a series of deep breathing exercises but will otherwise have no additional breathing training before surgery.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The researchers cannot promise that the study will help participants, but they anticipate that participants who perform breathing exercises before surgery will have fewer lung complications and recover from surgery more quickly. The results from this study may help improve the management of some complications that could develop after surgery, for other people having operations in the future.
      There are no known risks associated with performing breathing exercises. However, if participants have problems operating the breathing device or experience untoward events the local research team will provide contact details on joining the study.
      There should also be no risks associated with participating in the information study, as this only involves audio-recording conversations participants have with hospital staff and researchers. Most people find these conversations helpful but some can find it upsetting. If this happens, participants will be able to stop the appointment or interview at any time, without giving a reason.

TI  - Fermentable carbohydrate and gut hormone release
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11327221
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN11327221
AB  - Background and study aims
      In England, 60% of the adult population is overweight or obese. There is an urgent need to understand how dietary components effect appetite regulation. Previous research has demonstrated that increased dietary intake of fermentable carbohydrate promotes weight loss. Fermentable carbohydrates are not digested in the small intestine (the ileum) and therefore enter the large intestine (the colon) where they are fermented by the resident bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs have been shown to stimulate the release of appetite suppressing hormones called PYY and GLP-1 from the colon. Understanding how the gut senses ingested food to reduce food intake, will permit the design of foods that make people feel full. The aim of this study is to look at the effects of different types of carbohydrates on gut contents and the effects this has on how hungry people feel. This may be important in terms of controlling body weight and therefore preventing obesity.  
      Who can participate?
      Adults aged 18 and to 65 who have a BMI of 18-30 kg/m2.
      What does the study involve?
      This study involves three separate 4-day inpatient assessments. For each 4-Day study visit, participants stay at the Clinical Research Facility at Hammersmith Hospital for three nights. During each study visit participants are provided with a diet containing different types and amounts of carbohydrate rich foods (sugars, starchy foods, fruits and vegetables). They receive the different carbohydrate diets in a random order. The amounts of dietary fat and protein will be the same at each of the 3 study visits. On Day 1 of the study visit, participants have a tube placed through their nose by a trained medical professional under fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy is a type of medical imaging that shows a continuous X-ray image on a monitor, much like an X-ray movie. The end of this tube lies within the small intestine (ileum) allowing us to collect and measure the contents of the gut. 
      On the morning of Day 3, participants are provided with a test meal at approximately 09:00. Before the breakfast and for 8 hours afterwards samples will be collected from the tube to measure the gut contents. On the morning of day 4, a small plastic cannula tube is inserted into a vein in one arm. A vein is the type of blood vessel commonly used for taking blood samples. The cannula tube is used to take blood samples to measure the levels of hormones which control hunger in the body. During each study visit approximately 100 ml of blood (5 tablespoons of blood) is collected. At approximately 09:00 a test meal is provided and gut content samples and blood samples are collected throughout an 8 hour study period. After each sample is collected participants are asked to fill in a chart describing how hungry they feel. At approximately 17:00 on Day 4, the nasal tube and cannula tube are removed and participants are free to go home. In addition, participants are also asked to collect a stool sample on each day of the 4-Day study visit.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Taking part in the study will provide no direct benefit for participants. If any of the screening questionnaires or blood tests reveal any medical problems (e.g. diabetes, kidney or liver problems), the participant’s GP will be informed so that they can coordinate further care, arrange any further tests, and refer the participant on to Hospital Doctors if necessary. Insertion of the cannula on each of the study visits may cause minor discomfort or superficial bruising. Serious risks associated with the insertion of the tubes are very rare and almost negligible. These risks include bleeding, perforation or damage to the base of the skull. Minor discomfort of the back of the throat does occur in the majority of patients and may result transiently in a sore mouth, thirst, swallowing difficulties or hoarseness. The fluoroscopy procedure will expose participants to a small dose of radiation. The mean effective dose from each nasogastric tube procedure is equivalent to 2.8 months of natural background radiation (the same amount as you would be exposed to walking around outside) and would increase the risk of inducing cancer by 0.0025% (or 1 in 40,000). The minimum number of fluoroscopy procedures that will be conducted is 3. The maximum number of fluoroscopy procedures that will be conducted is 6.

TI  - Evaluating a new test of the immune system to better understand recovery from a severe reaction to an infection (sepsis)
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11364482
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN11364482
AB  - Background and study aims
      Sepsis is when severe infection leads to organ failure. It is a major global healthcare problem. Recent studies suggest as many as 49 million cases of sepsis worldwide each year leading to 11 million deaths. As sepsis care has improved more patients now recover from the early phases of sepsis but repeat occurrences are a major problem. Patients with sepsis often experience weakening of their immune systems known as immune suppression. This is now recognised as an important feature in a large proportion of patients who have sepsis and it leads to poor outcomes for these patients. At present there is no clinical test to assess the immune function of patients who have sepsis.
      The IMPACCT study will investigate whether it is possible to use a new diagnostic test to identify and classify patients with sepsis who are at higher risk of poor outcomes and developing new infections.  It is an observational study with no intervention or novel treatment introduced and no change to patients’ standard care and treatment when taking part.  
      Who can participate?
      Participants will be adult patients in intensive care who are being, or have been, treated for suspected sepsis and are receiving, or have received, organ support.  The patients will have been admitted to an ICU for over 48hours and less than 120 hours (5 days) and are expected to require ongoing care in an environment capable of providing organ support for at least one more calendar day. 
      What does the study involve?
      The study research team will collect data on the patient’s medical condition throughout their treatment in hospital and will conduct a clinical diagnostic test on participants’ blood samples.  Blood samples will be taken from patients at 3 time points during the study and will be taken from indwelling lines where present. The test is a rapid RNA-based diagnostic test that produces an Immune Profiling Panel (IPP).  Test results will not be shared with the research team or influence patients’ care.  Patients will be contacted 90 days after inclusion to complete a diary regarding their wellbeing and any new infections. Over a 2-year period, the study will recruit 600 patients in hospitals in the UK, France, and Sweden.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      As an observational study with no treatment or intervention introduced to patients, there would not be a direct benefit to patients from this study but the results may help future patients and assist doctors in the future in treating people more effectively and successfully.  There is no monetary benefit as participants will not be paid to participate.
      The physical risks of taking part would be expected to be minimal.  Taking blood samples can cause mild discomfort and bruising if taken from a vein.  These procedures will only be carried out by an experienced health professional under sterile conditions to minimise these risks. 
      The study team have considered, and sought to mitigate, risks to patients’ data and samples.  All data and samples will be collected, handled, processed and stored by the study team in a correct and respectful manner to the highest standards of confidentiality and security.  The study will comply with all relevant UK and EU regulations regarding data protection and participants’ biological samples.  Only de-identified or pseudonymised information would be shared between study partners.
      In confirming capacity to consent and communicating with participants, study team members have extensive experience of assessing capacity and caring for patients in intensive care settings.  The team is adept in providing information, answering questions from participants and their consultees, and considering the wishes and intentions of patients.  The team will all have received training in IMPACCT processes and procedures and would work in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12036902
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN12036902
AB  - Background and study aims
      This study is looking at two different germs: a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae (‘pneumococcus’, Spn) and a virus called Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These germs can cause a variety of symptoms from cold-like illnesses to chest infections or sepsis. When someone is exposed to both, which is very common in winter, it might affect how likely they are to develop infection or how serious their symptoms are. It is important to understand this relationship better so that future studies on treatments or vaccines can be performed.
      The study aims to understand how RSV and pneumococcus interact in the nose of healthy adult volunteers. The knowledge generated in this project could be used to help develop new interventions such as anti-virus agents and drugs targeting the host body response.
      Who can participate?
      Healthy volunteers aged 18 - 55 years.
      What does the study involve?
      If you are eligible and decide to take part, you would be deliberately expose in safe and controlled conditions to either RSV or pneumococcus first through drops in the nose. After this, participants will receive the other infection seven days later. Participants will be asked to self-isolate at home or remain in a medical facility after RSV exposure for up to 10 days to reduce risk to transmission to others. You would also have samples taken during clinical visits to assess immune response to the germs and you would be required to complete a short online diary for 21 days after exposure.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      You will be a valuable part of a research study that we hope will eventually lead to the development of new methods to prevent or treat respiratory infections. The risks from sample collection are limited to localised discomfort at the site of nasal sampling and discomfort and bruising at the site of blood sampling. Because you will be exposed to live RSV or pneumococcal bacteria there is a small risk of infection to you or your close contacts. Both germs have been used in previous studies in healthy adults with no serious side effects. You may however get cold-like symptoms, headaches, earaches, a cough or a fever. We will provide a safety pack as described above and you will have 24-hour access to the research team by phone.

TI  - Asp-PSC: effect of aspirin on reducing cancer & improving outcomes in primary sclerosing cholangitis
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12358813
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN12358813
AB  - Background and study aims
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an chronic autoimmune disease of the bile ducts and liver. PSC patients often have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Four out of ten people with both PSC and IBD get cancer of the bile ducts, gallbladder, liver or bowel. There are no screening strategies which reduce hepatobiliary cancers and there is no treatment shown to help slow the rate of PSC or reduce cancer risk. Aspirin may have anti-cancer effects and help reduce the PSC-related cancer risk. The main aims of the study are to investigate if daily low-dose aspirin over a minimum of 5 years reduces cancer risk in PSC and IBD patients. The researchers will also be looking at the safety and tolerability of aspirin and liver transplantation rates. There will be future work conducted on samples and imaging to establish if PSC-related cancers can be detected.
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged 18 years and over at least 12 months after a diagnosis of PSC-IBD
      What does the study involve?
      Participants will be randomly allocated to take a placebo or 75 mg once daily (oral) aspirin. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 5 years. Patients will attend a screening visit, month 1 phone call, 6 monthly visits over 5 years, and end of treatment. Follow-up data will be collected yearly after 5 years for a maximum of 5 years. Urine and blood samples will be taken at the screening visit and every 6 months over 5 years. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      If the trial shows aspirin significantly and safely improves cancer-free survival and overall survival in patients with PSC-IBD, then this could lead to a change in the standard of care treatment for these patients.
      Patients may experience some mild side effects from taking aspirin but risks have been mitigated by careful review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria by healthcare specialists on the Trial Management Group (TMG) to help screen for contraindications for aspirin and the researchers have avoided putting patients with decompensated liver disease onto the trial. They are monitoring side effects at every visit and patients will have a patient diary and contact number for surveillance of side effects. They are giving disease-related questionnaires to pick up changes in the activity of liver disease and Inflammatory bowel disease to alert clinicians of clinical changes. All side effects will be managed by the local Principal Investigator. All side effects will be reported on the electronic data capture system and reviewed by the clinical trial team as well at committee meetings including the TMG and Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to assess signalling for safety.
      There is a possibility of redness, swelling and bruising after blood collection and participants may feel lightheaded or faint. The blood samples will be collected at the screening and 6 monthly follow up only. Trained medical staff will be on hand to deal with side effects and the patient will be given a contact card to call for any concerns. There will be some blood collection for research samples, but these are optional.
      Patients' travel fees will be reimbursed. These extra visits will be explained in the patient information sheet and there will be a chance to ask questions at every timepoint. Patients have the option to withdraw at any timepoint if they do not feel comfortable attending extra visits. 
      A women’s health professor and Honorary Consultant in Obstetric Medicine was asked to join the Trial Management Group (TMG) to review the requirements for pregnant women to join the trial. It was deemed safe for pregnant women to join this trial. Further advice has been given in the protocol regarding the management of pregnant women and any side effects in this trial. We will be collecting additional data to monitor these patients and all patients will be monitored closely for side effects for the sub-study. All side effects will be reported on the electronic data capture system and reviewed by the clinical trial team as well at committee meetings including the TMG and Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to assess signalling for safety.

TI  - A study to see whether adalimumab or secukinumab is better for treating children and young people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) associated uveitis or chronic anterior uveitis
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12427150
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN12427150
AB  - Background and study aims
      The aim of the study is to see which treatment (Adalimumab or Secukinumab) is better for treating patients who suffer with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and Uveitis or chronic anterior Uveitis. JIA is the most common rheumatic disease in children. Around 1 in 1000 children in the UK develops JIA per year. Of these, 15-25% are at risk of inflammation of the uvea in the eye (known as uveitis). The majority of children with JIA are treated with a medication called methotrexate but over 40% need more medication to control uveitis. Adalimumab has shown to work together with methotrexate for controlling uveitis in JIA patients but for 27% of patients it didn't work. Secukinumab has shown to work in treating adults with uveitis. 
      Who can participate?
      The study will aim to recruit 50 patients with JIA associated uveitis or chronic anterior uveitis aged 2-18 years old from around 12 hospitals across the UK.
      What does the study involve?
      Participants will be involved in the study for 24 weeks of treatment and then 72 weeks follow up, if they are getting better with study treatment at 24 weeks then they may be able to carry on taking study treatment in follow-up. Patients will receive an ophthalmology and rheumatology review, be asked to complete some questionnaires, complete routine assessments (pregnancy test, urinalysis, physical examination, vital signs, height and weight, routine blood samples), complete a treatment diary and provide optional biobank samples.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Benefits:
      Not provided at time of registration
      Risks:
      Adalimumab has effects on the immune system and may cause the patient to develop infections and patients will be asked to notify their doctor immediately if they develop any of the following: sore throat, a fever, chicken pox, any other symptoms of infection or if the child hasn't had chicken pox and comes into contact with someone who has chicken pox or shingles. Chicken pox and shingles can be very severe in people who are treated with adalimumab and therefore an antiviral treatment may be required. Very rarely patients may develop a condition called "drug-induced lupus" while taking adalimumab, and would need to withdraw from the study treatment.
      There may be a slightly increased risk of certain types of cancer in patients using an anti-TNF drug. Whilst this has not been proven it is the subject of current research.
      Some patients may experience allergic reaction to either study drugs. Most reactions occur within two hours after the drug is given. Adalimumb may cause a reaction at the injection site i.e redness, swelling or pain. None of these are serious reactions. Secukinumab may make the patient more likely to develop infections and patients who develop the following should notify their doctor immediately: fever/flu-like symptoms/night sweats, tiredness/shortness of breath/cough which won't go away, warm & red painful skin/painful skin rash with blisters, burning sensation while urinating. Serious allergic reactions to Secukinumab may include: difficulty breathing or swallowing, low blood pressure causing dizziness or light-headedness, swelling of face/lips/tongue/throat, severe itching of skin with a red rash or raised bumps. Most other side effects of Secukinumab are mild to moderate and common side effects include: upper respiratory tract infections, cold sores, diarrhoea, runny nose, athlete's foot, headache, nausea, fatigue.
      Both treatments have side effects, however, they are outweighed by the benefits. Both treatments have been shown to improve symptoms of JIA uveitis but it cannot be guaranteed and it is also unknown which treatment is best.
      Participants and their family will be given details on who to contact if they experience any side effects, all safety events will be monitored by the research team throughout trial participant and reviewed at each trial visit.

TI  - Short treatment with the drug cyclophosphamide in bowel cancer
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12508004
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN12508004
AB  - Background and study aims
      Bowel cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the early stages of the disease, many patients can be cured with surgery.  However, in the later stages, bowel cancer can return or progress even after surgery and chemotherapy. One potential way of preventing relapse is by making the patient’s immune system better at detecting and destroying any cancer cells that might remain after treatment.
       
      T cells are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the immune system. They identify and destroy infected or cancerous cells in the body by recognising specific proteins found on the cells’ surface. Previous studies showed that T cells can recognise proteins expressed by bowel cancer cells. We have also completed a small clinical trial which demonstrated how using the drug, cyclophosphamide at a low dose can kick-start the T cell response to cancer cells, prolonging the survival of patients with very advanced bowel cancer. At this low dose, cyclophosphamide was found to be very safe. 
       
      The BICCC trial aims to test whether giving a low dose of cyclophosphamide for 4 weeks to stage 2 - 4 bowel cancer patients who have completed surgery/chemotherapy can help prevent relapse. Since cyclophosphamide kick-starts T cell response to cancer cells, we believe that this response may allow some patient’s immune system to destroy any remaining bowel cancer cells. Blood samples will be taken to study these anti-cancer responses in a small group of trial participants. 
       
      Who can participate?
      Eligible patients will be approached in approximately 10 centres across the UK including Wales, England and Scotland (500 participants; 250 participants in each arm).
      What does the study involve?
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either receive the trial treatment (low-dose cyclophosphamide) or be monitored by their clinical team for 13 weeks. All recruited patients will have 5 trial visits for monitoring and to receive tablets which they will take at home. Patients will be followed for three years, allowing us to measure if cyclophosphamide can prevent disease relapse.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Benefits:
      We cannot guarantee that there will be any direct benefits to you if you choose to take part in the BICCC trial. Some studies have shown that patients who take part in clinical trials may have better outcomes overall and that hospitals which are active in clinical research have better patient care outcomes. Some people also find the additional appointments with medical staff helpful. It is hoped that treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide may help slow down the relapse (growth) of any leftover cancer cells if they are present, but we cannot say for certain whether this will be the case for those allocated to receive it. Your participation will also provide information about the trial treatment and colorectal cancer that may change the way we treat patients in the future. 
      Risks:
      1. Trial treatment related side-effects:
      Cyclophosphamide (50mg twice a day) should not result in significant toxicities as confirmed in our clinical trial TaCTiCC, and studies carried out by other groups which have demonstrated its safety. At this low-dose, cyclophosphamide treatment is unlikely to cause suppression of immune responses. However, higher doses have been linked to immune suppression which can lead to serious infections. Patients with immunosuppression or severe infections will be excluded from the trial. Participation will be restricted for patients with severe impairment of bone marrow function, renal and hepatic failure. Patients' liver and renal function as well as blood count will be assessed during the trial screening process.
      Cyclophosphamide has the potential to cause harm to the reproductive system as well as to unborn children. Female participants of childbearing potential will take pregnancy tests before the start of cyclophosphamide. All patients of childbearing potential will be required to use contraception as necessary through the treatment course and 12 months after treatment.
      Good communication between patients and the local research team can help to ensure that patients are aware of any potential side effects. Participant information sheets will advise of the potential risks for the trial. Adverse events will be monitored by the trial team and reported to the relevant committees and regulatory bodies.
      2. The inconvenience of additional hospital visits:
      Patients will need to attend 5 additional hospital visits to receive their tablets, have their health and side effects monitored and provide blood samples. Patients from Swansea, Bath and Bristol will be offered the opportunity to travel to Cardiff for their trial treatment/monitoring. This will give this subset of patients (~100 local to Cardiff) the chance to participate in the optional translational immune response analysis (secondary and tertiary endpoint). This is essential as the blood samples need to be analysed rapidly. It will be communicated to these patients that this an optional part of the trial. This subset of patients will be reimbursed for their travel. 
      Patients in the active monitoring arm will be offered 2 telephone follow-up appointments at the discretion of the PI. 
      3. Keeping track of medication schedules and symptoms: Patients will be required to self-administer their medication twice a day and asked to keep a diary to log their symptoms, which can be time-consuming and difficult to remember. Local research team will explain the process of self-administration to the participants, and hand out, explain and review patient diaries to ensure patients understand their medication schedules and the process of logging symptoms.
      4. The risks of blood collection:
      Blood tests are considered safe with very minimal risks. Possible  adverse events of blood collection are tenderness/pain (mild and short-lived), bleeding/bruising, or feeling faint. Trained staff will perform the blood collection procedures using routine standard practices which address all the highlighted risks and ensure patient wellbeing at all times.
      5. Risk of breach of confidentiality:
      All recruited patients will be assigned a unique patient identification number. All trial data will be stored under the provisions of GDPR 2018. Any clinical information that leaves the hospital will have names and addresses removed to prevent participant identification.
      6. Risk of participants misunderstanding the trial:
      The trial will be clearly explained to all participants using the information sheet which has been reviewed by a patient representative. The patient information sheet and consent form will be provided in English (and Welsh on request).

AB  - Current plain English summary as of 10/01/2022: 
      Background and study aims
      Pain after surgery occurs in four out of every five patients and is a major public health concern. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate if a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) addressing pain management after surgery is possible. Other objectives are to: 1) identify solutions to challenges that may arise in conducting the study, and 2) obtain some data to determine how many patients will be needed for the larger RCT. We chose to study patients undergoing shoulder surgery since it is a common surgery associated with fairly severe pain that is poorly controlled with current opioid-based regimens.
      Who can participate?
      Adults who are 18 years or older and having shoulder surgery for rotator cuff injury or shoulder instability.
      What does the study involve?
      The study involves receiving one of three treatments that are routinely used at the participating hospitals. Patients will be randomized to receive: 1) a combination of pain medications before surgery, 2) a nerve block, or 3) a combination of pain medications before surgery plus the nerve block.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      We cannot guarantee that there is any personal benefit to participating in the study, i.e. that one treatment is better than the other. However, participants will have the opportunity to contribute to research in pain management. As all the study interventions are routinely used at the participating sites, the risks of this study are the same as the risks assumed when undergoing this surgery without participating in the study. We have reduced some risk by excluding people who are unlikely to benefit or at high risk of certain adverse events.
      Where is the study run from?
      Patients will be recruited in three hospitals: St. Mary's Hospital, Ottawa Hospital, and St. Joseph's Health Care London (Canada).

TI  - Ustekinumab in adolescents with recent-onset type 1 diabetes
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14274380
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN14274380
AB  - Background and study aims
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs when a person's own immune system attacks their insulin producing cells. When newly diagnosed, many T1D patients still have 10-20% of their insulin-producing cells still functioning. Ustekinumab is currently being used for other skin and bowel conditions and works by blocking the body's immune system. The aim of this study is to find out whether ustekinumab can delay or stop those remaining insulin-producing cells from being destroyed. If the drug works, it can potentially improve a patient's ability to control their blood sugar levels.
      Who can participate?
      Adolescents (aged 12-18) newly diagnosed with T1D 
      What does the study involve?
      Participants are tested to see if they still have insulin-producing cells left, and if they do, they are randomly allocated to take either ustekinumab or a placebo (dummy drug) as seven doses over 44 weeks. Blood and urine samples are collected for testing at study visits, which where possible coincide with their routine appointments. The participant and a nominated parent are also asked to complete three quality of life questionnaires. At week 52 there is a follow up appointment at the hospital, after which the researchers remotely follow up their health status using hospital records for another year. All females are asked to take adequate contraceptive protection and undergo pregnancy tests at the study visits. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Ustekinumab may help the pancreas make insulin for longer. However, this cannot be said for certain until this study is completed. During the study the participants’ diabetes will be very closely monitored. This will include regular check-ups with the local diabetes team including routine blood testing. They will have more time with the research team to discuss their diabetes and ask questions than at a normal clinic appointment. They will be provided with a FREE Abbott Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system. They can use this to check their blood sugar levels while they are in the study, although they will still be asked to do some finger prick tests. During the Milkshake test, participants may experience changes in blood glucose level because they will not have taken insulin immediately beforehand. The study nurses and doctors will be available to help them make any changes to their usual insulin doses after this test. Because the medicine (ustekinumab) acts on the immune system, there is a possibility that it will increase the risk of infections and cancer, but so far this has not been found to be a problem with people treated with this medicine for other diseases. It is also possible that participants may get an allergic reaction to the treatment injection. They will stay for one hour after their first injection to check for any reactions. Participants will have a chest X-ray to rule out TB which is additional to standard care. Chest x-rays involve using ionising radiation to form images of the body. Ionising radiation can cause cell damage in the longer term which can sometimes lead to cancer developing. However, only one x-ray is needed so taking part in this study will add only a very small chance of this happening. The risk is not much greater than that found with natural background radiation.

DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN14469511
AB  - Background and study aims
      Maxillary sinus cancer is a cancer in the area of the nose and nasal cavity. Despite extensive use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in planning surgeries to treat head and neck surgery, it has not been used before for assess the margins of tumours in maxillary cancer, where 30 to 50% of surgical resections (removals) result in incomplete removal of the tumor. CBCT is a medical imaging technique that uses the x-rays in a cone shape to create images. Therefore, with the goal of improving complete resection rates of maxillary cancer surgery, CBCT could be used during surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of intraoperative (during operation) of CBCT imaging to improve the amount of complete removals in maxillary cancer.
      Who can participate?
      Adults aged 18 and older diagnosed with maxillary cancer and scheduled for open maxillary resection (i.e. maxillectomy).
      What does the study involve?
      Participants undergo scans (MRI and CT scans) of their tumours. Participants then undergo their planned surgery. Next, surgical resection was preformed according to the standard practice. At the end of the surgery, a CBCT scan is done, in order to evaluate the resection by comparing preoperative resection plan and the other images, based on bone anatomy. If needed, further resections are performed and evaluated with a second CBCT scan. The differences are compared after the surgeries.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      There are no direct benefits or risks with participating.

TI  - Erdafitinib alone or in combination with cetrelimab as neoadjuvant treatment (prior to surgery) in subjects with muscle-invasive bladder cancer whose tumours express FGFR gene alterations and are ineligible for receiving cisplatin treatment
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14498712
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN14498712
AB  - Background and study aims
      The primary purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of erdafitinib (ERDA; a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)- inhibitor) alone or in combination with cetrelimab (CET; an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) as neoadjuvant treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) whose tumours express FGFR gene alterations. ERDA is an experimental drug in this clinical trial and is being studied as a potential new treatment in the neoadjuvant setting of patients with non-MIBC which carry specific alterations in the FGFR family. CET is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)) being studied in the treatment of several tumours, including bladder cancer. A combination of CET plus ERDA seems an interesting approach in FGFR-mutated bladder cancer due to different mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicities, as shown in a phase II study in metastatic UC. The SOGUG Group (Sponsor) is a non-profit scientific association whose aim is to promote and develop specific programmes of study and research in the field of genito-urinary tumours.
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged over 18 years old with metastatic bladder cancer
      What does the study involve?
      The number of patients planned in this study is 90, with 45 in each cohort. There will be 21 study sites in 4 countries that will participate in the main study. Treatment will be assigned through a centralized allocation by order of arrival.
      In the ERDA group, the patient will receive Erdafitinib (ERDA) in monotherapy neoadjuvant treatment with erdafitinib alone (cohort 1: Erdafitinib) before proceeding to radical cystectomy (RC) (to be performed within 2 - 6 weeks after the end of treatment)
      In the erdafitinib (ERDA) and cetrelimab (CET) group, patients will receive treatment neoadjuvant with erdafitinib alone (cohort 2: Erdafitinib + Cetrelimab) before proceeding to radical cystectomy (RC) (to be performed within 2 - 6 weeks after the end of treatment).
      When the treatment period ends, the patient will have an end-of-trial visit and an imaging and laboratory test before proceeding to surgery. The overall study duration is 60 months.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      To protect the patient’s safety, the study doctor will evaluate medical records, and perform physical examinations and laboratory studies to decide if the patient can participate in the clinical trial. As with all medicines, the drugs that will be used in this study may cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them. During the study, patients will be carefully monitored to detect the possible onset of these effects. 
      The most common side effects of each drug used in this study are indicated below. These side effects may or may not be more intense when the drugs are administered jointly. These are the risks and side effects that could be related to each drug:

TI  - The effect of a calcium delivery system on tooth decay in head and neck cancer patients treated by radiotherapy
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14942820
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN14942820
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of head and neck cancer that starts in the upper part of the throat behind the nose. It is the most common head and neck cancer affecting Singapore men and is primarily treated with radiotherapy. The major side-effects of radiotherapy are dry mouth, increased saliva acidity and increased bacterial count, which significantly increase the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) is a milk product which helps in remineralization and prevents dental caries. Its effectiveness has been shown in the healthy population but its benefit for NPC patients has not yet been established.  At the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS), the standard treatment for the control of dental caries in NPC patients treated with radiotherapy is the life-long daily use of 0.4% stannous fluoride gel.  However, clinicians have noticed that these patients are still experiencing tooth decay. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effect of CPP-ACP on dental caries progression at the tooth surface level in NPC patients treated with radiotherapy when used together with the standard fluoride gel.
      Who can participate? 
      Patients aged 21 years or older who have been diagnosed with NPC and are undergoing radiotherapy for the first time
      What does the study involve? 
      Participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups. The control group receive standard fluoride gel and a placebo (dummy) creme whilst the intervention group received the standard fluoride gel and CPP-ACP creme. All participants are reviewed at five study visits: two visits before the start of radiotherapy, mid-radiotherapy, 2 weeks and 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. At each study visit, an oral examination is carried out. Saliva is collected and tested for fluoride levels.   
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      The study aims to increase knowledge of the effect of CPP-ACP on caries lesion progression at the tooth surface level, which may improve the future treatment and management of caries in NPC patients. If CPP-ACP does become effective for those participants who receive it, the participant may have a reduced risk of dental caries while he/she is in the study. All participants are provided with a SGD$40 transport allowance when he/she returns for each study visit. In addition, all oral care products such as the standard fluoride gel, creme, fluoride toothpaste and toothbrush are provided free of charge. The review charges of the study visits are also waived. CPP-ACP is made from casein, a milk protein, so potential participants with a known allergy to milk casein or hydroxybenzoate preservatives are not allowed to participate in the study.  If a participant experiences any allergic reaction to the fluoride gel and/or creme, the participant should immediately seek medical advice, stop using the oral care products and inform the attending dentist and study co-ordinator.

TI  - A trial to determine if withholding anticoagulation is not worse than standard anticoagulation therapy in the treatment of blood clots in the lungs
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN15645679
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN15645679
AB  - Background and study aims
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a condition where blood clots cause a blockage of the blood vessels in the lungs. PEs are often caused by blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) breaking off and travelling to the lungs. The symptoms of a PE depend on the size and location of the blood clot and can include breathlessness and chest discomfort. The standard treatment for PE includes anticoagulant drugs commonly referred to as “blood thinners”. Anticoagulants include a drug called warfarin, direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) tablets, or a type of drug called “low molecular weight heparin” that is injected under the skin. These drugs stop new clots from forming while the body breaks down clots that may have already formed. A PE is diagnosed by a scan of the lungs, which is most commonly a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). This gives doctors images of the pulmonary arteries, a small PE in these blood vessels is called a “subsegmental pulmonary embolism” (SSPE). 
      As the CTPA scanning technology for PE has become more sensitive, smaller clots are being diagnosed. The CTPA scans are now able to detect smaller blood clots in blood vessels of the lungs; these clots are only a few millimetres in size and are the subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (SSPE).  
      The current standard treatment for pulmonary embolism is anticoagulant drugs. The aim is to reduce future blood clots (PEs and DVTs). It is unclear if the smaller clots, the SSPEs, require treatment with anticoagulation as these smaller PEs may be broken down by the body itself without the need for any treatment. Patients with SSPE who are treated with anticoagulation could be more at harm due to the risk of bleeding than they are helped by preventing future blood clots. This study will compare the outcomes among people with SSPE who have no anticoagulation treatment with those that are anticoagulated. The results of this will help us find out which is the best treatment plan for patients with SSPE.
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged 18  and older with a subsegmental pulmonary embolism
      What does the study involve?
      Participants are randomly allocated to either continue with standard anticoagulation or to have no anticoagulation treatment at all and are assessed after 12, 24 and 52 weeks.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Although participants may not receive any individual benefit from taking part in the study, the results may help to improve the treatment of patients with SSPE in the future. If the participant is allocated to have anti-coagulation treatment then the potential risks are the same as usual care which will have already been discussed with the participant. The participant may experience bleeding from the anticoagulants, which can be minor like a small nose bleed or sometimes more severe (where the participant might need to come to hospital to have a blood transfusion). If the participant is allocated to the no treatment group then they are less likely to have either bleeding as they will not be on anticoagulants, but they may get another blood clot in the lungs (PE) or legs (DVT).  The participant will be given a patient card that explains the symptoms to look out for which should prompt them to seek healthcare in case they have had another PE or DVT.

TI  - A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMY109 in women with endometriosis
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN15654320
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN15654320
AB  - Background and study aims
      Endometriosis is a chronic gynaecological disorder associated with pelvic pain and infertility. The disease is not only dependent on the female hormone estrogen-dependent but is also an inflammatory gynaecological disorder Women can be treated with pain relief medication and/or hormone treatment. Sometimes the endometriosis tissue is removed by surgery to help relieve
      symptom. If the inflammation can be treated it is thought that pain may be reduced and infertility symptoms could improve.
      This study looks at whether an experimental drug called AMY109 can reduce the inflammation and pain caused by endometriosis when it is given, either on its own, or in combination with desogestrel (a progesterone only contraceptive pill) compared to desogestrel alone. Treatment will be assigned randomly to one of three groups with a 37.5% chance of being placed in groups 1 and 2 and a 25% chance of being put into group 3.
      • Group 1: AMY109 & desogestrel-placebo
      • Group 2: AMY109 and desogestrel
      • Group 3: AMY109-placebo & desogestrel
      Placebo is a dummy drug which looks the same as the active form but contains no active ingredient.
      Who can participate?
      Women who are generally in good health and who have endometriosis diagnosed via a laparoscopy but who haven’t yet had surgery to remove endometrial tissue within 9 months. Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled from approximately 8 centres in the United Kingdom (UK).
      What does the study involve?
      Eligible women from participating or referral centres will be invited to join the study. Firstly, there will be a washout period of between 4 and 12 weeks where certain medications will be stopped so that they are removed from the body. This will be followed by a screening period which could last up to 45 days to check that the participant is eligible for the study. Eligible participants will then receive AMY109 or a dummy drug for up to 52 weeks. They will also be asked to take either desogestrel or a dummy pill every day. Four weeks after the treatment has finished, the endometriosis will be removed surgically via laparoscopy where small incisions are made near the belly button or bikini line. Follow-up visits will be on Weeks 60, 77, 89 and 105. The total duration of the study will be a maximum of 29 months, including approximately 22 hospital visits.
      The severity of the endometriosis will be measured during the course of the study by using MRI scans (up to three times) and up to three trans vaginal ultrasounds (ultrasound using a probe inserted into the vagina). It will also be measured by examination of images of the endometrial tissue before and after treatment and by examination of removed endometrial tissue and fluid at the time of surgery.
      Eligibility assessments at the start of the study and ongoing safety assessments will include up to three chest X-rays and up to seven electrocardiograms (ECGs). Vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature and heart rate) will be measured at every visit and blood samples will be taken to assess both the health of the participant and also to look at how the drug is processed by the body, how the body responds to the drug and whether the body is making any antibodies to the drug. The total amount of blood collected during this study may be approximately 400 mL (about 3-8 teaspoons at each visit).
      Participants will have to use the pain medication provided as part of the study and also agree to use two forms of barrier contraception from consent (for example, a combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide).
      Participants will also be asked to complete a daily diary either using an App on their own phone or a handheld device. There will be questions related to how they are feeling, quality of life, any vaginal bleeding, the level of pain experienced, and the amount of pain medication taken each day.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      AMY109 is an experimental drug so there are no known health benefits at this time. Because there is limited testing in humans, there may be side effects that are not known at this time.
      The most common events observed in healthy volunteers receiving AMY109 were throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), sore throat (pharyngitis), and infection of the upper respiratory tract i.e. nose, nasal cavity or throat.
      The most common side effects observed in patients with endometriosis receiving AMY109 were vomiting, anaemia, diarrhoea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, and symptoms of common cold (nasopharyngitis).
      The most common side effects observed in patients with cancer who were receiving AMY109 were fever (pyrexia), constipation, diarrhoea, increased liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase) and anaemia.
      AMY109 is a type of drug known as a biological agent. Theoretical risks include the possibility of causing hypersensitivity, infusion reaction, or anaphylactic reaction (a type of allergic reaction that could be serious), from a mild rash to a life-threatening reaction and could also possibly make it easier to get infections (for example respiratory infections) or delay wound healing. As there may be a risk in exposing an unborn child to study drug participants have to agree to use two forms of barrier contraception throughout the study and follow up.
      There are also some risks with taking desogestrel, the most common risks (noted in about 1 in 10 women) include altered mood, depressed mood, decreased sexual drive (libido), headache, nausea, acne, breast pain, irregular or no menstruation and increased body weight.

TI  - Can proton beam therapy improve survival and reduce late side effects compared with standard-of-care intensity-modulated radiotherapy in patients with sinonasal cancer?
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN15983654
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN15983654
AB  - Background and study aims
      Cancer of the sinuses (the air spaces in our nose and facial bones) is a rare disease, which is often found to be quite advanced by the time it is noticed. The treatment for sinus cancer usually involves surgery followed by radiotherapy, but radiotherapy may also be used without surgery. In some cases, chemotherapy may also be used to treat the cancer. Radiotherapy is an important part, either to treat the cancer itself (where surgery has not been done) or to treat the cancer cells that remain after surgery (without radiotherapy these cells would grow back). The current treatment is intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a newer form of radiotherapy, which may be more effective at treating cancer or cancer cells to improve the chance of cure. It may also cause less damage to nearby normal structures, resulting in fewer side effects. However, this is unknown and it is also possible that some side effects may be increased by protons. PROTIS aims to compare PBT with IMRT, to see whether or not there is an improvement in cure rates and a difference in long-term side effects.
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged 16 years old and over diagnosed with sinus cancer, histologically confirmed by the hospital to be either sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) or sinonasal adenocarcinoma (SNAC). 
      What does the study involve?
      The study aims to recruit 276 patients, and each participant will be involved in the study for up to 5 years after treatment. When taking part in PROTIS, there is a 50:50 chance (which is decided randomly) that participants will be allocated to receive either IMRT (standard of care) or PBT. Regardless of which treatment participants receive, radiotherapy will be delivered daily (excluding weekends) for up to 7 weeks. If participants are receiving IMRT, it will be delivered at their local hospital as if they were not taking part in the trial. If they are to receive PBT, this will be delivered at one of the two NHS proton beam centres in the UK (The Christie, Manchester or University College London Hospital (UCLH), London). Usually, this will be the centre closest to the participants' home but other factors are considered for example capacity at the centres. This will mean travelling to the specialist unit and staying away from home during treatment (up to 7 weeks). Reasonable travel expenses are reimbursed, and the NHS provides apartment accommodation for the patient and one family member or carer. The doctor or nurse will provide further information about this.
      Before starting treatment, participants will need to attend a planning visit at the treating hospital. This may be at the proton beam centre if allocated to PBT in the trial. They will meet the members of the team and will attend some clinical appointments. During this time, they will have a mould/mask made which will be worn during all the radiotherapy treatments. These appointments are likely to occur across several days.
      There are several other treatments/assessments involved in the trial as well as the radiotherapy. Some of these are the same as standard of care but others are additional. To treat the cancer some participants will be offered surgery before radiotherapy; others may be offered chemotherapy. The decisions about what is required will be the same whether they are taking part in the trial or not. If they are having surgery, the team would like to take some biopsies, which can be used to answer some important research questions. To understand potential long-term side effects the clinical team will perform some tests/ assessments. The first set will be before starting radiotherapy, these are called baseline assessments. These tests include clinical assessment, blood tests, hearing tests, eye examinations, and tests to check the sense of smell and brain function including attention, memory, language, reaction time and perception, thinking and memory. Participants will also be asked to complete a few questionnaires about their quality of life. These same tests will then be repeated at different time points after their radiotherapy so that any changes can be tracked.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The results from this study will be used to help us improve treatments for patients with sinus cancer. It is known that most patients having radiotherapy will experience some side effects. Part of the PROTIS trial is to understand whether PBT can reduce the side effects of radiotherapy. At the moment we do not know if this is the case.

AB  - Background and study aims
      Cancer is a health condition where the body's cells start growing and multiplying in an uncontrolled and abnormal way. Instead of following the usual pattern of cell growth, these cells form a lump or mass called a tumor. Breast cancer is a health condition where cancer cells form in the breast. Despite how well the available treatments are working, the cancer ultimately returns in many patients after it improved for a while, or the cancer stops responding to the treatment. This study tests a medicine called giredestrant. It is being developed to treat breast cancer with estrogen receptors, which are little proteins found in the cancer cells. Giredestrant is an experimental medicine. This means health authorities (like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) have not approved giredestrant for the treatment of breast cancer. This study aims to test how much giredestrant reaches the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it when it is given along with itraconazole or carbamazepine to healthy female participants who are unable to become pregnant. 
       Who can participate?  
      Healthy females of 18-65 years of age with breast cancer, who could not become pregnant took part in the study. Patients treated with any drug that specifically works on the estrogen receptors, which are little proteins found in the cancer cells, are unable to take part in this study. 
      People who are pregnant, or breastfeeding are unable to take part in the study. 
       What does the study involve? 
      Participants will be screened to check if they can participate in the study. The screening period will take place approximately 5 weeks before the start of treatment.  
      Everyone who joins this study will be split into two groups, Group A and Group B. Both groups receive two treatment periods, Periods 1 and 2. Participants are able to take part in only one group of the study. 
      In Group A, participants are given giredestrant, as a pill by mouth on Day 1 of Period 1 and then on Day 4 of Period 2 along with itraconazole given as an oral liquid. Participants are given itraconazole on Days 1 to 14 of Period 2.  
      In Group B participants are given giredestrant, as a pill by mouth on Day 1 of Period 1 and then on Day 15 of Period 2 along with carbamazepine, also given as a pill by mouth. Participants are given carbamazepine on Days 1 to 21 of Period 2.  
      This is an open-label study. This means everyone involved, including the participant and the study doctor, will know the study treatment the participant has been given. 
      During this study, the participants are confined at the study site for at least 26 days (Group A) or at least 31 days (Group B). Participants received a follow-up telephone call from the study doctor to check on their well-being after approximately 8 to 10 days of completing the study treatment. Total time of participation in the study was about 6 weeks for group A and 7 weeks for group B, excluding the 5 weeks of screening. Participants had the right to stop study treatment and leave the study at any time if they wished to do so. 
       What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?  
      Taking part in the study may or may not make participants feel better. However, the information collected in the study can help other people with similar health conditions in the future.  
      It may not have been fully known at the time of the study how safe and well the study treatment worked. The study involves some risks to the participants. However, these risks are generally not greater than those related to routine medical care or the natural progression of the health condition. People interested in taking part are informed about the risks and benefits, as well as any additional procedures or tests they may need to undergo. All details of the study are described in an informed consent document. This includes information about possible effects and other options for treatment. 
      Risks associated with the study drugs 
      Participants may have unwanted effects of the drugs used in this study. These unwanted effects can be mild to severe, even life-threatening, and vary from person to person. During this study, participants will have regular check-ups to see if there are any unwanted effects.  
      Giredestrant: 
      Participants are told about the known unwanted effects of giredestrant and possible unwanted effects based on human and laboratory studies or knowledge of similar medicines. Known unwanted effects include pain or stiffness in the joints (arthralgia), frequent watery stools (diarrhea), the feeling of spinning, being unsteady and losing balance (dizziness), tiredness, muscle or bone pain, queasy feeling in the stomach that gives the sensation of wanting to vomit (nausea). 
      Itraconazole: 
      Participants are told about the known unwanted effects of itraconazole. Known unwanted effects include shortness of breath, headache, the feeling of spinning, being unsteady and losing balance, heartburn, runny nose, a persistent feeling of sadness, and loss of interest that can affect daily functioning (depression), hair loss, and fever. 
      Carbamazepine: 
      Participants are told about the known unwanted effects of carbamazepine. Known unwanted effects include increased thoughts of suicide, liver damage feeling of spinning, being unsteady, and losing balance, frequent watery stools, heart failure, blurred vision, and fainting.

TI  - Meningococcal B Booster Vaccine in Young People
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16774163
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN16774163
AB  - Background and study aims
      In 2015 4CMenB Vaccine (Bexsero®) (a vaccine against the bacteria meningococcus B) was added to the UK routine immunisation schedule for infants. The aim of this study is to determine if it is sufficient to give a single booster dose of 4CMenB to 11 year olds who have received a full course of the vaccine in their infancy, in order to ensure that they are protected from meningococcal B disease in adolescence. The reason to consider this is because meningococcus B causes disease in two main waves, the first in infancy and the second in adolescence. 
      Who can participate?
      Children aged about 11 who received 4CMenB as part of studies done at the Oxford Vaccine Group around 11 years ago, and children of the same age who have not previously received 4CMenB
      What does the study involve?
      Children who received 4CMenB are assessed to determine if they still have immunity against meningococcus B so many years after receiving the vaccine, and are given a booster dose of 4CMenB to see whether their immunity can be sufficiently topped up with just a single dose of the vaccine. Children who have never received a meningococcal B vaccine before usually require two doses to become immune to the disease. These children are randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group receives one dose of 4CMenB at visit 1 (day 0) and a second dose at visit 4 (day 365). The other group receives one dose of 4CMenB at visit 1 (day 0) and a second dose at visit 2 (day 28). All participants are followed up at the same timepoints (Day 0, Day 28, Day 180 and Day 365) with blood samples collected at each visit to compare the immune responses of the different groups of children with different schedules of 4CMenB. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The study will ultimately inform decisions about whether or not to include an adolescent booster meningococcal B vaccine into the UK routine immunisation schedule. Benefits include receiving a booster dose or a full course of 4CMenB. These children are about to enter into their adolescent years in which the risk of meningococcal disease rises, and they will benefit from the protection provided by this vaccine. As the vaccine used in this study is a licensed product, the risks to participants are the same as if they received any licensed vaccine. There is a very small risk of allergy or anaphylaxis to the vaccine, but the vaccine has undergone stringent safety testing. There is a risk of bruises from the blood tests in this study.

PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17533723
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN17533723
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are cancers that usually begin in what are called squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal (mucus producing) surfaces inside the head and neck (for example, inside the mouth, nose and throat). HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer in the world and accounts for about 6% of all cancers. If, once treated, the cancer comes back or if it spreads (recurrent/metastatic – or R/M), the prognosis is poor, with patients surviving only about 8 months, on average.  Cetuximub  with platinum-based therapy plus  5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered the first line treatment of choice for R/M HNSCC, but its costs are of concern, particularly for developing countries. Hence, cisplatin combined with 5-FU is still the most common treatment for R/M HNSCC in Taiwan.  Research has shown that a drug called tegafur/uracil (UFUR) when used in combination with cisplatin, produces similar results as 5-FU and is well-tolerated by patients. In addition, studies have found that the combination of irinotecan and cisplatin is a treatment that works well. This study is investigating the performance and the safety of  a irinotecan/cisplatin/UFUR (IUC) triple combination treatment,  by determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), how much of the treatment is needed to cause toxic effects (dose-limiting toxicities – or DLTs), how well patients tolerate the therapy and how successful it is at treating R/M HNSCC.
      Who can participate? 
      Adults aged between 20-75 with R/M HNSCC.
      What does the study involve? 
      This study is split into two stages, with different participants involved in each stage. For stage 1, the participants are given different doses of irinotecan, with the dose increasing until they develop DLTs. The MTD is then calculated as the dose below the dose that results in DLTs for one third of the participants in the study. For stage 2, participants are given the MTD of irinotecan combined with cisplatin and UFUR twice a day for 5 days every two weeks per their treatment cycle.  Each participant taking part in stage 2 of the study has computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans of their tumors done before starting their treatment and then every 3 months until their disease progresses or they withdraw from the study for another reason. This is to see how they respond to the treatment.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      It is hoped that the combination of irinotecan to the cisplatin and UFUR, will prolong progression free survival and overall survival. Risks include  myelosuppression (decrease in bone marrow activity, leading to fewer red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). Other possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis (pain and inflammation of the body tissues that produce mucus) and infection.

TI  - A study in healthy volunteers to investigate how different recipes and the particle size of an ingredient in the test medicine affects how the test medicine behaves
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17780768
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN17780768
AB  - Background and study aims
      The sponsor is developing the test medicine fenebrutinib for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance, and affects about 2.3 million people worldwide. There are medical procedures available that may involve piercing or cutting into the body or inserting instruments (invasive treatments) that target a type of white blood cells called B-cells have been shown to be an effective treatment of MS, however, the Sponsor is developing a medicine that can be taken orally (by mouth) which would provide a less invasive therapeutic option for patients with MS. This three-part healthy volunteer trial will try to identify how new recipes (formulations) of the test medicine are taken up by the body (pharmacokinetics), the level of test medicine in the blood following oral dosing (relative bioavailability) and try to provide additional safety and tolerability information for the test medicine.
      Who can participate?
      Male and female volunteers of non-childbearing potential, aged between 18 and 60 years
      What does the study involve?
      In Part 1 and Part 2, up to 15 volunteers will receive single oral doses of different recipes of the test medicine across three periods. Part 3 is optional, and if utilized, up to 16 volunteers will receive single doses of different recipes of the test medicine across two periods. In each part, volunteers will be discharged on Day 3 of the final period and will receive a follow-up phone call 7 – 10 days after the final dose. Volunteers’ blood will be taken throughout the study for analysis of the test medicine and for their safety. Volunteers are expected to be involved in this study for 7 weeks for Part 1 and Part 2, and 6 weeks for Part 3, from screening to the follow-up call.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      This is a healthy volunteer study. Participants will be administered fenebrutinib only for research purposes and it is not intended that the participants will receive any benefit from it. However, the information learned in this study may help future patients. Participants will be compensated for taking part in this research study with an inconvenience allowance.
      It is considered that the risk/benefit evaluation in this study supports the use of healthy volunteers. As MS affects both men and women, both healthy male volunteers and healthy female volunteers of non-childbearing potential will be enrolled in this study. There is always a risk that the stipend in healthy volunteer studies could represent coercion. The time spent in the clinic, travel, inconvenience and other expenses factor in calculating the stipend. Perception of risk is not considered in this calculation. Volunteers may experience side effects from the test medicine. Full information on possible side effects is provided to volunteers in the Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form. When investigating new medicines there is also a risk of unexpected side effects and occasionally allergic reactions. All volunteers will be closely monitored during the study and safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals. Risks are further mitigated by ensuring that only volunteers who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria are included and that if the safety of any volunteer represents a concern they will be withdrawn. There will be an extended period of fasting for the volunteers taking part in this study. To ensure an adequate fluid intake, the volunteers will be allowed fluids up to 1 hour before dosing and from 1 hour after dosing, will be provided with 240 ml of water at dosing, and will be monitored for signs of dehydration and fatigue. Blood samples will be collected during the study. Collection of these samples can cause soreness and bruising of the arms but these problems usually clear up within a few days to a few weeks. ECG stickers on volunteers' chests and limbs may cause some local irritation and may be uncomfortable to remove but volunteers will be closely monitored to ensure any local irritation does not persist.

TI  - A study with patients who have swallowing difficulties and are artificially ventilated with a direct access tube to assess the benefit of using the Phagenyx device for early removal of the direct access tube
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN18137204
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN18137204
AB  - Background and study aims
      Patients suffering from a variety of conditions including stroke or artificial ventilation typically have difficulty with swallowing, which is known as neurogenic dysphagia. A common problem caused by difficult swallowing is that food or drinks may go down the wrong way and end up in the lungs where they can cause serious chest infections. Patients who are artificially ventilated with a direct access tube, known as a tracheotomy tube, often experience swallowing difficulties and the tracheotomy tube can remain in place to prevent complications associated with swallowing difficulties. To treat the symptoms of difficult swallowing, patients are often given special training or swallowing techniques to use, but these are not always effective. There are alternative treatments. One of these is PES, which is a simple and harmless technique for treating difficult swallowing. PES treatment is delivered using a medical device (Phagenyx) that is commercially available and that can be used by patients’ care teams on a routine basis at the bedside. The Phagenyx treatment is given through a tube inserted into the throat and is very similar to the type of tube used to temporarily feed people with swallowing difficulty. It can also be used to provide medicine and liquids. The aim in this clinical study is to assess if PES treatment can help stroke patients with a tracheotomy tube in place have the tube removed earlier than in patients who do not receive the treatment at the same timepoint.
      Who can participate?
      Adults with swallowing difficulties after stroke
      What does this study involve?
      The study will involve observing how the devices work and documenting the outcome of the treatment. Apart from the PES treatment, no additional specific medical interventions are required in this study and patients will continue to receive standard care as recommended by their care team. Patients will be randomly allocated to either the early or the late treatment group. All patients will receive the same standard PES treatment; however, those in the early group will receive the standard PES treatment immediately (0–24 hours) after randomisation. PES involves stimulating the nerves in the throat (pharynx) for 10 minutes each day for 3 days in a row to improve the swallowing function. The intensity or level of stimulation is adjusted on each day so that it is at the right level for the patient. An attempt to remove the tracheotomy tube will take place for patients in both the early and late treatment groups at the same timepoint after randomisation. If the tube cannot be removed successfully, patients in the early treatment group will receive a second standard PES treatment and patients in the late treatment group will be given their first standard PES treatment. After this standard PES treatment, there will be another attempt to remove the tracheotomy tube.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?  
      Although the Phagenyx treatment is safe, it is not impossible that an unanticipated risk may occur during the study, but the chances of this happening are small and steps have been taken to make sure it is as safe as possible for patients to take part. All patients in the study will be carefully watched for any side effects. Possible risks are that the insertion of the treatment tubes through the nose can cause mild, but temporary, irritation of the nose or throat (experienced staff will carry out this procedure to minimise the discomfort) and electrical stimulation of the throat can sometimes cause a moderate warm sensation at the back of the throat, but this sensation is not painful.

TI  - Otilimab in patients with severe coronavirus-related lung disease
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN18205700
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN18205700
AB  - Background and study aims
      COVID-19 is a condition caused by the coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in late 2019. This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe. 
      In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of April 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus. 
      Groups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus.
      Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop severe lung complications that require as a minimum oxygen treatment in hospital. This study will test a type of medicine that is a monoclonal antibody called otilimab. Normally, the body’s immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping to fight infection. Monoclonal antibodies are made in a laboratory and have been purposefully designed to work as medicines by targeting specific cells or substances in the body. Otilimab blocks a specific chemical messenger called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) which is involved in inflammation. Higher levels of GM-CSF are found in the blood and lungs of patients with severe pulmonary COVID-19 related disease. It is thought that blocking GM-CSF will improve lung function, improve clinical status, and improve the chances of survival. The aim of this study is to test how well otilimab works in COVID-19 patients who have developed severe lung complications compared to placebo, both with the best standard of care.
      Who can participate?
      Hospitalized participants with new-onset hypoxia (tissues of the body are starved of oxygen) requiring significant oxygen support or requiring mechanical ventilation.
      What does the study involve?
      Each participant will be randomly allocated to receive a single dose of otilimab or placebo (dummy drug) given as an infusion (IV) in addition to standard of care. A placebo is a medicine that looks like the study medicine but doesn’t contain any active medication. There is a 50% chance of receiving either otilimab or placebo chosen randomly by a computer. The participant, site staff or GSK will not know which treatment they had until after the study has finished. There will be a screening period, IV dosing at Day 1, daily clinical and safety assessments until discharge or Day 28, whichever is sooner, regular blood tests, and follow up at Days 42 and 60. During the study, participants may require a chest x-ray. There will be no further treatment available with otilimab at the end of the study.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      There may be no perceived benefit to the participant other than the increased monitoring of the participants’ disease. Information from this study will help doctors and scientists to learn more about COVID-19-related respiratory disease and its treatment. This information may help future patients with COVID 19 respiratory-related disease. Otilimab has been given to just over 400 people in completed clinical studies. These studies have involved healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Otilimab is currently being investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in ongoing clinical studies. More than 700 patients in total have been enrolled to date. To date most people have tolerated otilimab well but there are some potential risks. Since otilimab works on the cells in the immune system, participants may be at risk of:
      Cytokine release syndrome: Antibody drugs like otilimab can, in rare instances, trigger a widespread abnormal inflammation response within the body. This can potentially be life-threatening, and might cause additional symptoms: rash, headache, nausea, tiredness, vomiting, confusion, rigors low blood pressure, breathing difficulties, increased need for oxygen, muscle aches, worsening kidney function, worsening liver function, other laboratory test abnormal values, and multi-organ system failure that can be fatal. Based on our understanding of otilimab action this risk is thought to be very rare.
      Allergic reaction: Antibody drugs like otilimab may cause allergic reactions, although in general, severe reactions happen very rarely.
      Increased risk of infection: Otilimab acts on the immune system and may reduce the participant's resistance to infection. The participant may also be at increased risk of getting an infection (including lung infection). Infections have been reported in participants who received otilimab in clinical trials; however, the exact effect of otilimab on causing infections is not yet known. 
      Risk of changes in blood cell counts: Otilimab may reduce the number of certain types of blood cells (in particular neutrophils) and may make the participant more prone to infections. 
      Because otilimab reduces normal activity of GM-CSF in the lungs there is a risk of:
      Lung disease: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (or PAP) is a very rare lung disease known to be caused by reduced levels of GM-CSF in the lungs. It is characterised by the build-up of grainy material in the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs which makes it difficult for the lungs to absorb oxygen and over time leads to breathing difficulties. There is a risk that treatment with otilimab could result in the development of PAP; however, in this study this risk is considered very low because only a single dose of otilimab will be administered on day 1. To date, PAP has not been seen in any clinical studies with otilimab.
      Delayed recovery to infection: GM-CSF has been noted to play a role in helping the lung fight infection and recover from any injury. Therefore, it is possible that otilimab, by blocking GM-CSF, may affect the ability of the lungs to fight lung infection or properly recover from infection
      Other risks include:
      Risk of cancer: otilimab may reduce the activity of the immune system. Medicines that affect the immune system may increase the risk of certain cancers. So far, an increased risk of cancer has not been seen in any of the previous clinical or animal studies with otilimab.
      Injection site reaction: As the study drug will be given through an IV cannula, there is a risk of developing local inflammation around the injection site. This could include redness, swelling and infection.

AB  - Background and study aims
      COVID-19 is a condition caused by the coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in late 2019. This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe. 
      Multiple vaccines against COVID-19 have been shown to be effective in phase III studies and several of these have been granted approval for use. There are likely to be significant logistical challenges immunising large portions of the population. There would be significant advantages to having flexible immunisation programmes where the second vaccine dose is not necessarily the same as the first dose. 
      The main aim of this study is to determine the safety as well as the immune responses to a variety of combinations of schedules for receiving the first dose (prime) and second dose (boost) of candidate COVID-19 vaccines that will potentially be deployed in the UK. The vaccines to be studied in this protocol will primarily be determined by those likely to be made available to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for population use, including COVID-19 mRNA Pfizer Vaccine BNT162b2, Oxford/AstraZeneca ChAdOx1, COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna and Novavax NVX-CoV2373, with the potential to add additional vaccines at a later date. Furthermore, as the UK introduction of COVID-19 vaccines has used an extended (up to 12 weeks) interval between the first and second dose of vaccine, this study will evaluate combinations of vaccines with an 8-12-week dosing interval. Additional objectives of the study are to characterise COVID-19 infections experienced during the study by participants and to look at the immune response to those infections.
      Who can participate?
      Adult volunteers aged at least 50 years, including those who have other medical conditions, as long as those conditions are mild or moderate in severity and are well controlled at the time of volunteering for the study. Individuals of all ethnicities are eligible to be recruited, with the recruitment of those identifying as Black and Minority Ethnic particularly encouraged in order to try to reflect the diversity of the UK population 
      What does the study involve?
      This trial will be studying combinations of different vaccines. Participants will be allocated at random (rather like a flip of a coin) to receive a dose of the same vaccine (homologous) or a dose of a different vaccine to the one they received as part of the national rollout (heterologous). Between five and seven routine blood tests will be taken over the course of a year to look at the immune responses to the vaccine depending on the group a participant is in. Participants may also be asked for a nasal fluid sample at each visit. Participants might also be asked to attend for a repeat blood test if there were any safety concerns. Participants undergo tests to check their blood count is ok (not anaemic), and tests to check that levels of blood salts, liver and kidney function are normal. If a participant were to test positive for the virus causing COVID-19 they are asked to attend for an extra visit. Participants will also need to complete an online diary for up to 28 days following their vaccination. The trial will take 1 year to complete per participant (from the time the first dose of vaccine is given). The study team will not be offering diagnostic COVID-19 testing as part of this trial, but it is important that participants in this trial access COVID-19 testing outside of the trial following normal government guidance.  
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participants should have a lower risk of COVID-19 disease than unimmunised individuals. Although the heterologous prime/boost schedules have not been tested or approved as yet, the UK ‘Green Book’ guide to immunisation notes that for vaccines based on the spike protein, it is likely that the second dose will help to boost the response to the first dose, therefore it is expected that those in the heterologous group will receive some protection. It is anticipated that this will apply to the Novavax vaccine if it is approved. Participants may benefit from a slightly early receipt of a boost dose vaccine. 
      The risks and side effects of the proposed study procedures are: 
      1. Localised bruising and discomfort associated with blood samples
      2. Localised discomfort associated with mucosal fluid sampling
      3. Possible allergic reactions to vaccines (rare but can be serious)
      4. Side effects from receiving vaccines such as pain in the vaccination site and flu-like symptoms for a short period afterwards (e.g. muscle aches and chills)
      5. There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement, also known as vaccine-associated enhanced disease. This is where having a vaccine can alter the immune response to an infection it is protecting against and make inflammation in the body worse. This has not yet been seen in any previous trials of COVID-19 vaccines but remains a theoretical risk. 
      6. Participants may alter their behaviour in relation to COVID-19 risks and precautions on the assumption that they are completely protected from the vaccines received in the trial. Participants will be advised to follow all current COVID-19 government advice.
      7. Participants may receive unwanted media attention from participating in the trial.
      Added 19/04/2021:
      8. Following reports of blood clots with lowered platelets following immunisation with the AstraZeneca vaccine a review has been undertaken by the MHRA and the EMA (European Medicines Agency). The reports were into a very rare type of blood clot in the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), and in some other organs together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) that might be associated with vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Up to and including 31 March 2021 there have been 79 UK reports of these blood clots and unfortunately 19 people died. By 31 March 2021 20.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been given in the UK. This means the overall risk of these blood clots is extremely rare, approximately 4 people in a million who receive the vaccine.  All participants in this study will be provided with up-to-date information from regulators on this finding.  Participants will be advised to be aware of possible signs and symptoms of blood clots and to have a low threshold to contact trial teams if experiencing these or other symptoms.

AB  - Background and study aims
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a program designed to reduce dysfunction after surgery and enable the recovery of the patient as soon as possible. Patients are eligible for inclusion in this study if they are undergoing major colorectal surgery, which traditionally includes a prolonged rehabilitation period after surgery. The aim of this study is to establish an ERAS protocol for patients undergoing colorectal surgery based on previously standardized evidence-based enhanced recovery programs (ERPs). The objective is to monitor the impact of ERAS protocol on death rates, length of stay and complications after surgery. It is expected that the implementation of an ERAS protocol will reduce the cost of colorectal surgery, improve quality of life, reduce patient length of stay and improve patient outcomes. 
      Who can participate?
      Patients undergoing major colorectal surgery
      What does the study involve?
      Participants will be asked to follow a care pathway for colorectal surgery. The pathway from pre-surgery to recovery is specifically designed to help patients heal more quickly, eat and move sooner, and optimally control pain. Studies show that this program helps patients feel better and recover more quickly. Participants are asked to follow the guidelines described within the ERAS handbook. This includes stopping smoking 4 weeks before surgery, eating optimally, getting some exercise, early return to diet after surgery, and getting out of bed and moving (with help) as soon as possible after surgery. 
      The Surgery care team in Huntsville (Huntsville District Memorial Hospital site of Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare) will review the Enhanced Recovery steps with participants before their surgery, during their hospital stay, and before they go home. The main steps involved in this care pathway are pre-admission counselling, fluid and carbohydrate loading and early mobilization. Participants will answer a questionnaire which will include questions regarding patient outcomes and complications after surgery. Data will be collected for 15-30 days after the surgery. Participating in this study involves providing feedback and allowing data to be included in the study. Names and any personally identifying information will not be included with the study data. For research purposes, participants will be assigned a random identification. When publishing the results of this study participants name and information will be grouped with other participants to ensure identification is not possible.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The only risk involved in participating in this study would be inadvertent sharing of data, but patient names will not be linked to study data so this risk is minimal. The benefit of participating is in showing other similar sized institutions that this program is effective and manageable in a small rural facility.

TI  - Investigating a vaccine against plague
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN41077863
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN41077863
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Plague is a disease caused by infection with Yersinia pestis, which is a type of bacteria. In humans, this infection can cause high fevers, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, bloodstream infection and, if left untreated, death. It is spread by the bite of an infected flea, the handling of an animal infected with plague, or from inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected person.  
      There are three different forms of plague infection; bubonic, pneumonic and septicaemic. Bubonic plague is characterised by swollen and painful lymph nodes near to where the bacteria entered through the skin. Pneumonic plague is where the bacteria is breathed into the lungs and results in shortness of breath, fever and coughing up blood. If pneumonic plague is not treated with antibiotics within 24 hours there is almost a 100% chance of death. Both bubonic and pneumonic plague can develop into septicaemic plague, which is a life-threatening infection of the blood. 
      Plague is found across the world, but the biggest burden is in very remote and poor parts of Africa and Asia. During 1998-2016, a total of 13,234 suspected cases of plague were recorded in Madagascar alone. Plague can be treated effectively with antibiotics, if treated early, however, this is often not possible in rural areas, where a vaccine would be much more effective.  
      Some effective vaccines against plague are available in some parts of the world, however, they are not ideal for various reasons. The University of Oxford has developed a new plague vaccine, which can be given by injection into the arm. The vaccine is made with a virus that has been modified to make it harmless, and this virus vaccine carrier has already been tested in humans (most recently with a vaccine against COVID-19 and also Meningitis B)  and shown to be safe. This new plague vaccine needs testing to see if it is safe and produces an effective response from the immune system in healthy participants. All participants will be monitored closely throughout the trial, with blood and nose-fluid samples taken to see what is happening in the immune system. 
      Who can participate? 
      Male or female volunteers aged 18-55 inclusive who are in good health and able to travel to the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine in Oxford regularly over one year (updated 16/09/2021, previously: Male or female volunteers aged 18-55 inclusive who are in good health and live in the Thames Valley or surrounding area).
      What does the study involve? 
      Participants will receive either one or two doses of the investigational vaccine, ChAdOx1 Plague. The researchers will then take blood and nose-fluid samples at follow-up visits and record any symptoms that occur after vaccination. There will be up to 14 study visits (depending on which group a participant is in) over a 12-month duration 
      What are the possible risks and benefits of participating? 
      Recipients of ChAdOx1 Plague do not receive any guaranteed benefit. However, it is hoped that the information gained from this study will contribute to the development of a safe and effective vaccine against plague. The only benefits for participants would be information about their general health status. 
      The main potential risks are those associated with phlebotomy (blood taking) and vaccination. Localised bruising and discomfort can occur at the site of blood taking. Sometimes people can faint when having their blood taken. The total volume of blood drawn over a 12-month period will be up to 630 ml. This should not have any bad effect on healthy people. In the UK, volunteers are permitted to donate 470 ml during a single blood donation for the National Blood Transfusion Service over a 3-4 month period. Volunteers will be asked to refrain from blood donation for the duration of their involvement in the trial. 
      Allergic reactions from mild to severe may occur in response to any constituent of a medicinal product’s preparation. Anaphylaxis is extremely rare (about 1 in 1,000,000 vaccine doses) but can occur in response to any vaccine or medication.  
      The typical reaction where a vaccine is given is temporary pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling at the site of the injection. People can also have “flu-like” symptoms after any vaccination, such as feverishness and achiness, and this can last for 2- 3 days. Sometimes people feel faint when they see a needle or have an injection.  As with any other vaccine, temporary ascending paralysis (Guillain-Barré syndrome, GBS) or immune-mediated reactions that can lead to organ damage may occur, but this should be extremely rare (100,000-1,000,000 vaccine doses).  
      Synthetic absorptive matrix (SAM) strips are used to sample the nasal fluid from inside the nostril. Sometimes this can make people sneeze or have a runny nose.  Rarely, this can cause nosebleeds.  These SAM strips are made of soft cotton-like material and insertion should not be painful.

PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN45249890
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN45249890
AB  - Background and study aims
      The purpose of the study is to collect blood and tumour samples from patients whose cancer has got worse while receiving treatment or following treatment with a drug called a PARP inhibitor, which is used to treat certain types of cancer.  The samples will be analysed to help us understand what type of changes have occurred in your cells.  This will involve looking at the DNA (DNA carries genetic information and it tells cells what proteins to make), RNA (RNA is used by the body to make proteins) and the proteins in the cells that are tested. 
      We know that certain changes in a person’s DNA, RNA or proteins could mean that they may benefit from treatment with a new type of drug that is being developed (called a DNA polymerase theta inhibitor – this is a drug that can stop the repair of damaged DNA and therefore may kill cancer cells).  We would like to understand how many people have these changes and if we can detect them. This information should help us to devise the best tests to identify patients who could benefit from this new type of drug that is being developed.  
      The study is planned to last for up to 2 years.
      Who can participate?
      Male and female patients aged 18 years and over who have disease progression following treatment with a PARP inhibitor.
      What does the study involve? 
      This is a tissue (blood or tumour biopsy) collection study. Samples will be collected from up to 50 patients. We would like to collect the following samples from you, however if you wish you can decide not to provide the biopsy sample described in point 3 below. You would still be to be able to participate in this study by giving a blood sample only. 
      Tumour or blood samples that were taken before you started any treatment with a PARP inhibitor and have been stored by the hospital (if they are still available). The sample may be used to look at your DNA, RNA or protein. 
      A blood sample – this will be collected at the same time as a blood sample is collected from you for routine testing or when your biopsy sample is collected. This will be up to approximately 4 tablespoons of blood. The blood sample will be used for DNA analysis. 
      A biopsy sample (a small piece of tissue which would be no bigger than the size of a pea) from your tumour. This could be collected during a procedure that is part of your standard care or the biopsy may be collected specifically for this study. The biopsy sample may be used to look at your DNA, RNA or protein. 
      In addition to the collection of the samples you will also be contacted by telephone 28 days after the biopsy sample was taken (if you have agreed to provide this) to find out if you had any side-effects from the procedure.  
      Information from your medical records and clinical information about your cancer will be recorded for the study. 
      Your participation in the study will be for up to a maximum of 2 months. If you decide to participate in the study, you can choose to leave the study at any time without needing to give a reason. 
      What are the benefits and risks of participating?
      Benefits
      There are not expected to be any direct medical benefits to taking part in the study. Patients diagnosed with cancer in the future may benefit from an increased understanding of the type and frequency of changes that occur when a cancer gets worse during treatment, or following treatment with a PARP inhibitor. If we find out that there are changes that could result in improved treatment with another type of drug known as a DNA polymerase theta inhibitor, this will enable us to use this type of drug in the future in a more personalised way. We might be able to predict whether an individual will benefit from receiving the drug. If this is possible it would prevent us giving the drug to patients who are unlikely to benefit from it. 
      Risks
      If you have a biopsy you may suffer some side-effects from it. The type of side-effects you may suffer will depend on the type of biopsy that is performed.  
      Where a needle biopsy is performed, the tissue is obtained by inserting a needle into the tumour after a smaller needle has been used to inject some medicine to numb your skin called anaesthetic. You may experience a brief sharp pain from the needle used to inject the anaesthetic. The biopsy needle that will remove the sample of your tumour will produce a dull pain. There may be bleeding, bruising, swelling, infection, or scarring at the site of the biopsy. Your doctor may offer you a medicine to calm your nerves and help you to relax before or during the biopsy procedure. You may be given pain killers after the biopsy to help manage any pain. 
      If the biopsy is collected by inserting a tube through the mouth, nose, rectum or urethra or by surgery you may experience pain and discomfort as a result. Your doctor may use a local anaesthetic or a general anaesthetic during the biopsy procedure. You may be given pain killers after the biopsy to help manage any pain. There is also the rare possibility that serious complications from bleeding or organ damage may occur, and this may result in additional surgery. 
      Infections can also occur as a result of the biopsy, though the risk is estimated to be less than 1 in 100. If you do develop an infection you may be given antibiotics. 
      The biopsy may be guided using a CT scan. CT scans are quick, painless and generally safe. But there's a small risk you could have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye used. In rare cases, patients can suffer from kidney problems as a result of this reaction. This CT scan would be extra to those CT scans that you may have as part of your standard care. This procedure uses ionising radiation to form images of your body. Ionising radiation may cause cancer many years or decades after the exposure. The chances of this happening to you as a consequence of taking part in this study are less than 0.14% 
      During the collection of the blood samples there could be bruising at the site where the needle is inserted. There may also be an inflammation of the vein, infection, redness, pain, bleeding, blood clots (which may cause inflammation, swelling and pain), and nerve damage. The blood samples will be collected into more than one tube.

AB  - Background and study aims
      Six weeks of radiotherapy treatment is carried out for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer, a type of head and neck cancer, with the aim of long-term cancer control or cure. Unfortunately, some cancers recur after finishing radiotherapy. If oropharyngeal cancer comes back, it usually recurs in the same place it was at diagnosis. 
      Giving a higher dose of radiotherapy to this area might help keep cancer under control for longer. However, increasing the dose of radiotherapy for all patients is not required. Our previous research showed that a tool used for the evaluation of treatment response and assessment of disease progression called a diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI scan, carried out before and during treatment can determine which patients are most likely to have a recurrence. This study will use these scans to identify which patients are at risk of their cancer coming back after treatment.
      Who can participate?
      Adult patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
      What does the study involve?
      A DW-MRI scan will be done before the start of radiotherapy and repeated after 2 weeks of treatment then analysed by the specialist team.
      If the MRI scans show the cancer is not responding to the usual radiotherapy dose, a higher dose of radiotherapy will be given for the second half of the treatment. If the scans show the cancer is responding well to radiotherapy, the standard dose of radiotherapy will continue to be delivered.
      Identifying cancers in patients where the radiotherapy is not working well enough during treatment and changing the radiotherapy plan may lead to better treatment in the long term but are very different to how things are done now. One aim of this study is to see how practical the extra steps involved in changing the treatment plan are and work out the best way of doing this. The study will also gather information from participants about side effects and the impact on patients' quality of life during and after treatment – an important way for us to make sure that increasing the dose of radiotherapy is acceptable.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      A possible benefit of participating is a higher chance of the participants' cancer being kept under control or cured. Some participants may also benefit from increased support during the monitoring of the study and regular contact with members of the study team.
      Possible risks of participating are listed as the following possible side effects:
      Side effects associated with radiotherapy treatment (radiotherapy is standard of care so no additional risk with participating in the study): 
      1. Tiredness. Most patients feel extremely tired after radiotherapy and plenty of rest is recommended. Tiredness can continue long-term. 
      2. Skin soreness. The area where radiotherapy is given (face and neck) may become red and sore after treatment (like sunburn). The team can prescribe creams to manage this. 
      3. Skin fibrosis. In the long term, skin can become thicker and darker. 
      4. Dry mouth. Saliva can become thick and sticky. In the long term, the patient may need to rinse their mouth frequently with water or use artificial saliva. 
      5. Oral mucositis. This is an inflammation of the lining of the mouth causing sores, pain and possible infections that are usually treated with painkillers and antibiotics. Mouthwashes will be prescribed to help with these symptoms.  
      6. Poor appetite and weight loss. The patient may be referred to a dietician for nutritional advice.
      7. Swallowing problems. Swallowing can become difficult. Most patients will need to change their diet (for example soft food only). During treatment or within 3 months after the end of treatment a temporary feeding tube through your nose or your stomach may be necessary. The need for the feeding tube in the long term is quite rare (less than 10% of patients). 
      8. Alteration of your taste. Taste will change. Most patients describe their food as tasting “metallic” or “like cardboard”. In the long term, most patients report minimal taste changes or complete recovery.  
      9. Osteradionecrosis of the mandible. The jawbone can be affected by radiotherapy (this happens in less than 10% of patients). The patient may develop pain, infections or tooth loss. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Some patients can benefit from painkillers and vitamins. In rare cases, surgical treatment is required. 
      Modern radiotherapy techniques allow us to reduce harm to the surrounding healthy organs while delivering high doses of radiotherapy to the tumour.
      Possible side effects associated with study tests: 
      Blood sample collection. This may cause a small amount of bleeding and temporary discomfort or the patient may feel faint. Sometimes a bruise or redness develops at the site where the needle was inserted (but this will clear after a week or two). Patients are asked to inform the study doctor or research nurse if they experience any reactions at the injection site.
      DW-MRI scan. Side effects from the dye injected for the scan may include nausea, vomiting or headache. Allergic reactions are rare.
      Research Biopsy. This may cause pain, bleeding and bruising at the site of the biopsy. The biopsy can also cause a sore throat or infection at the biopsy site.
      Participants will be monitored closely for these and any other side effects and will have regular appointments with the study doctor, nurse, or radiographer as well as a telephone number to contact the research staff if they are concerned about possible side effects.
      Where possible, other treatments may be given to make side effects less serious or uncomfortable. Many side effects go away after the study treatment is reduced or stopped but in some cases, side effects can be serious, long-lasting, or permanent (even with standard treatment). 
      Although we are able to target the radiotherapy accurately to the tumour we know that side effects still occur as the healthy tissue around the cancer is exposed to some radiation. The chances of more serious side effects may be slightly higher with the increased dose of radiotherapy than the standard dose.  Experts designing this study and reviewing the study independently think that this is very unlikely.

PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN49416083
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN49416083
AB  - Background and study aims
      This study compares Ester-C® and ascorbic acid (AA) by analyzing their effects on leukocyte (white blood cell) and neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) function. Studies have shown that acute doses of 1000 mg of Ester-C® led to higher concentrations of AA in leukocytes for up to 24 hours compared to AA alone. Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the human body and require AA to protect them from oxidative damage. Studies have shown that low levels of vitamin C can impair neutrophil function, while supplementation can improve it. The researchers hypothesize that acute supplementation with Ester-C® will lead to better leukocyte and plasma AA levels and improved neutrophil phagocytic function compared to AA alone.
       
      Who can participate?
      Healthy male and female adults aged 18 to 60 years old 
      What does the study involve?
      This study involves repeat blood draws after the ingestion of a low or high dose of either Ester-C (which provides AA) or AA by itself in hopes of evaluating comparative leukocyte AA accumulation kinetics. Moreover, to evaluate comparative leukocyte AA accumulation in the body, plasma AA accumulation kinetics, and neutrophil phagocytic function. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The study cannot promise any benefits to the participants. However, possible benefits include increased insight into their personal health. Possible risks of the study include a small amount of pain when the needle and/or catheter is inserted into the vein as well as some bleeding and bruising during the blood draws. The participant may also experience some dizziness, nausea, and/or faint if they are unaccustomed to having blood drawn. Risks that are possible but unlikely include infection, nerve damage and puncturing an artery instead of a vein. The treatments may cause possible nausea, vomiting, esophagitis, heartburn, abdominal cramps, gastrointestinal obstructions, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, insomnia and sleepiness. Although allergic reactions to vitamin C are rare, symptoms may include; itching or swelling in the face, lips or mouth, skin rashes, hives, asthma, sinus pressure, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, wheezing, sinus headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain. One of the risks of being in this study is that personal information could be lost or exposed. This is very unlikely to happen, and the researchers will do everything possible to ensure that private information is protected.

TI  - Assessing Dutch-language versions of two questionnaires design to assess the impact of side effects of radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN49549338
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN49549338
AB  - Background and study aims
      Radiotherapy uses radiation to kill cancer cells. Along with surgery, it is the most frequently used treatment for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC, cancer in the mouth, nose and throat). Unfortunately, radiotherapy in the head and neck area can also damage healthy tissues. This can reduce people's ability to carry out daily activities of life as they did before, which can then impact on their quality of life (QoL). The most common side effects during radiotherapy are radiation dermatitis (skin irritation and soreness), oral mucositis (mouth irritation and soreness), xerostomia (dry mouth), loss of taste, fatigue, dysphagia (swallowing problems) and dysphonia (problems with speaking). 
      Oral mucositis tends to be the problem that results in a reduction in radiotherapy dose or frequency. It results in pain, bleeding and infections, which can lead to problems with swallowing and reduction in food intake. Since this side effect has a significant impact on QoL, it is important to assess oral mucositis in patients with HNC during their treatment.
      All of the radiation-associated side effects can severely affect patients and their social, family and work activities and relationships. They can even harm a person's self-esteem. This means it is also important to assess patients' abilities to perform daily life activities and their quality of life.
      The aim of this study is to translate from English to Dutch two questionnaires that assess the impact of oral mucositis and the impact of HNC radiotherapy on the patient's ability to speak, diet and ability to eat in public and to assess their usefulness in measuring the impact on the patient.
      Who can participate?
      Adult HNC patients treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (drug treatment combined with radiotherapy) 
      What does the study involve?
      All patients are asked to fill out three questionnaires before the start of radiotherapy and during weeks 3, 4 and 5 of radiotherapy. At the same times, a cancer radiotherapy specialist will assess their side effects and a speech specialist will interview the patient to assess their speech, diet and ability to eat in public.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      There are no additional risks or benefits of participating in this study, since the patients will receive their cancer treatment as normal.

PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN49798431
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN49798431
AB  - Background and study aims: 
      Otitis media, also known as glue ear, is a common condition, especially in young children. Whilst we know that glue ear often gets better by itself, thousands of children each year experience prolonged hearing loss, which can lead to further problems. If hearing loss lasts longer than 3 months, children are usually offered hearing aids or a grommet operation. Several small research studies have suggested that treatment with oral steroids might help glue ear get better quicker. Oral steroids reduce inflammation in the body and are often used to treat conditions like asthma. However, the research done so far is not as good as we would like it to be, so we still can’t say for definite whether a child with glue ear will benefit from treatment (e.g. improved hearing, glue ear gets better, no longer needs an operation for grommets) with an oral steroid. We want to answer these questions by testing the use of oral steroids (prednisolone sodium phosphate) in a research study being run from Cardiff University. 
      Who can participate? 
      Children aged between 2 to 8 years who have been referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) outpatient clinic with symptoms of hearing loss due to glue ear for at least 3 months.
      What does the study involve? 
      The study involves visiting the ENT clinic for a hearing assessment and taking home a short course of oral steroids to be given to the child once a day for 7 days, by dissolving it in liquid. We also ask parents to complete a diary recording their child’s symptoms and any additional healthcare consultations their child has had over the subsequent 5 weeks. There will be follow up assessments at the ENT clinic at 5 weeks, 6 and 12 months.  
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      A possible benefit of this study is that there may be a possibility that if the treatment works, the child’s hearing will improve so that they will no longer need hearing aids or grommet surgery. In addition, the child will also have extra assessments and monitoring in the ENT clinic, which may be helpful. Participants in this study will be helping us answer questions about the treatment of glue ear in children that should result in better care for children with this condition in the future. Taking part in the study will mean giving up some time. There is a chance that the child might develop side effects from the study treatment. However, side effects are uncommon with these treatments (especially when only taken for short periods of time), and are not usually serious.

TI  - An interventional study to evaluate the safety and immune response of a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection) when given to healthy adult participants
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN51232965
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN51232965
AB  - Background and study aims
      COVID-19 is a condition caused by the coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in late 2019. This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe. 
      In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of April 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus. 
      Groups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus.
      This study is being conducted to look at the safety and immune response (how the immune system of the human body reacts) to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.
      Who can participate?
      Healthy male and female volunteers aged between 18 and 55 years of age (Part 1) and healthy older volunteers aged 56 years and older (Part 2)
      What does the study involve?
      Participants will be given one of three (low, intermediate, high) dosages of the vaccine or placebo (dummy vaccine) as an intramuscular injection (injection directly into the muscle) to the upper arm on two occasions at least 28 days apart.
      Participants will be asked to report any side effects or changes in health following vaccination via an electronic diary. Participants will report to the study site at various times during the study and undergo the following procedures:
      1. Oral temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured
      2. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed to assess heart rhythm
      3. A physical examination will be performed to assess general health. This will include measuring body weight
      4. About 15 ml (about three teaspoons) of blood and a urine sample will be collected to assess general health. The urine sample will also be collected to test for drugs of addiction. Additional safety samples may also be collected if required by the study doctor
      5. An alcohol breath test
      6. A throat swab will be performed and the sample will be sent to a lab to test for the presence of COVID-19
      7. A urine sample will be taken to test for pregnancy. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test, a blood test will be performed to confirm pregnancy status
      8. A blood sample will be collected to assess the effect the study vaccine has on the body. About 34 to 73 ml of blood (7 to 14 teaspoons) will be collected at various times during the study visits
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participation in this study may help develop important scientific knowledge that could contribute to the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 Sclamp vaccine is an experimental medication, therefore the risks to human participants have not been fully evaluated. The study vaccine has not been administered to humans so the risks at this time are unknown.

PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN57377850
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN57377850
AB  - Background and study aims
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single dose of the drug cyclosporine on the processing by the body of a single dose of the drug pralsetinib in healthy volunteers.
      Who can participate? 
      Healthy volunteers aged 18 years and over
      What does the study involve?
      On Day 1, 200 mg of pralsetinib (2 x 100-mg capsules) will be taken orally after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. On Day 10, 200 mg of pralsetinib (2 x 100-mg capsules) will be taken orally within 5 minutes after a 600-mg dose of cyclosporine (6 x 100-mg capsules) and after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      Participation in this study is purely for research purposes, and will not improve health or treat any medical problems. The information from this study may help patients in the future. Participants may benefit by having physical examinations. The results of laboratory tests done at the screening visit will be made available upon request. However, if participants are disqualified for study participation by other screening procedures, some laboratory tests may not be conducted.
      Participants may have side effects from the drugs or procedures used in this study. Side effects can be mild to severe and even life-threatening or fatal, and they can vary from person to person.
      Pralsetinib has had limited testing in humans. About 200 healthy volunteers and 700 oncology patients have received pralsetinib thus far in human studies. In the largest human study, 578 cancer patients have received pralsetinib daily over several months (mainly double the dose in this study) and their observed side effects are included in the list shown below.
      Very common side effects (occur in 10% or more of patients):
      1. Decrease in blood cells, such as white blood cells, which may increase the risk of fever and infections, red blood cells (anemia), which may result in fatigue and shortness of breath, and platelets, which may increase risk of bruising or bleeding. The decrease in blood counts may need to be treated with medicines that stimulate the blood cells to grow or may require a transfusion.
      2. Increase in blood pressure 
      3. Liver problems (increased liver function blood test results). Participants who get any signs or symptoms of liver problems (for example yellowing of your skin or the white part of the eyes (jaundice), dark “tea-colored” urine, sleepiness, bleeding or bruising, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting) should inform their doctor immediately.
      4. Abnormal liver function tests (that is, possible liver damage)
      5. Inflammation in the lungs (pneumonitis) that could cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, which can sometimes be life-threatening or fatal
      6. Diarrhea or loose stools
      7. Bleeding (in stomach or intestines but also in other parts of the body)
      8. Constipation or difficulty opening the bowels
      9. Increases in the amount of phosphate in the blood that may cause minerals to deposit in internal organs, such as the stomach and may lead to kidney damage
      10. Increased creatinine in the blood, which can be a sign that the kidneys are not working properly
      11. Increase in enzymes (creatine phosphokinase), which can be a sign of muscle or tissue damage
      12. Change in taste
      13. Fatigue
      14. Dry mouth
      Common side effects (occur in between 1% and 10% of patients):
      1. Infections, mostly not serious, but sometimes life threatening or fatal (for example, pneumonia and lung infections, urinary tract infection, or infection in the blood)
      2. Nausea and vomiting
      3. Swelling of the hands or feet
      4. Headache
      5. Rash (local or generalized skin eruption)
      6. Abdominal pain
      7. Pain in extremities, back pain, pain in muscles, bones, or joints
      Uncommon but important side effects (occur in between 0.1% and 1% of patients):
      Because of the relatively low number of patients treated to date, it is not possible to determine any side effects in this category.
      Cyclosporine is a drug used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. It is also administered to patients receiving organ transplants in order to weaken the immune system to prevent organ rejection. Side effects that may be experienced when taking cyclosporine include:
      1. Kidney dysfunction 
      2. Tremor 
      3. Hirsutism (excessive hair growth) 
      4. Hypertension (high blood pressure) 
      5. Gum hyperplasia (swelling of the gums)
      Serious side effects include: 
      Damage to the kidneys and liver
      When more than one drug is taken at a time the side effects can be worse or different than when taking the drug by itself. Please talk to the study doctor or staff about any questions or concerns that you may have about the procedures required for this study and their risks.
      In addition to the risks listed above, there may be unknown, infrequent, and unforeseeable risks associated with the use of these study drugs, including severe or life-threatening allergic reactions or unexpected interactions with another medication. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include rash, flushing, itching, sneezing or runny nose, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, swelling of face, tongue or throat, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, trouble breathing, irregular or racing heart rate, and seizures.

AB  - Background and study aims
      Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues. Certain proteins, called tyrosine receptor kinases (TRK), present on the cell surface control a message that tells the cells to grow and multiply. Dysregulation of the TRK proteins often causes cells to lose the ability to grow normally leading to cancer. Entrectinib, the drug that is being studied, is designed to block the wrong messaging caused by the dysregulation of these proteins. Entrectinib has been approved by health authorities in an oral capsule formulation for cancer treatment. A new investigational form of the drug (i.e., a liquid with solid particles in it [suspension form]) is being evaluated in this study. The use of entrectinib in this study is experimental, which means health authorities have not approved the oral suspension of entrectinib for the treatment of cancer.
      The aim of Part 1 of this study is to compare how much of the study drug enters the circulation of the body (to have an active effect) when given as the original reference capsule formulation given by mouth (oral) compared to the new suspension formulation given orally or through a special tube that carries medicine to the stomach through the nose (nasogastric tube).
      In Part 2, the original capsule formulation will be compared with oral lansoprazole given along with the new suspension formulation given orally to determine how safe and tolerable entrectinib is when given in the different forms, and to evaluate the effect of lansoprazole on the amount of study drug that reaches the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it.
      Who can participate? 
      Healthy volunteers of age between 18 and 55 years
       
      What does the study involve? 
      The study includes two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. The participants will be enrolled in one of the two parts of the study. The total duration of the participation in either part of the study will be about 10 weeks, including the screening visit. Each part of the study involves three stages: 
      1. Screening: The participants will be screened to make sure they are a good fit for the study. They may have to visit the clinic once during the screening period which will be done within 28 days before the first dosing.
      2. Dosing/Confinement Phase: The participants will receive three study treatments in three study periods in both parts of the study. The study treatments administered in this study include: entrectinib oral capsule, entrectinib suspension (given with water or milk) and lansoprazole oral capsule. Both the entrectinib formulations will be administered on Day 1 in Part 1 (periods 1, 2 and 3) and Part 2 (periods 1 and 2). Entrectinib oral suspension on Day 5, Part 2 (period 3). Lansoprazole will be administered on Days 1 to 5 in Part 2 (period 3). The order of dosing will be determined by chance (like a flip of a coin). There will be at least 14 days between each dosing. Participants will have to fast for at least 8 hours prior to dosing and 4 hours after the dosing. 
      3. During this study, the participants will have three clinic confinements lasting either 6 days/5 nights each or 10 days/9 nights depending upon the part of the study or the visits.
      4. Follow-up (to check on the participant after treatment is finished): Participants will receive a follow-up phone call after 12 to 14 days of the final dosing.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      The study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition. Participants may not receive any direct medical benefit from participating in this study, but the information collected will help people with cancer in the future. Participants might receive compensation of up to a maximum of $10,525 depending upon the part of the study and the visits. Participants may have side effects from the drugs or procedures used in this study; these may range from mild to severe and even life-threatening, and they can vary from person to person. There is a risk of death from side effects. Certain side effects have been determined to be associated with entrectinib following dosing over an extended period and are not likely to occur with administration of only one dose of entrectinib, based on clinical trial experience in participants with advanced cancer the known side effects are described below:
      Very common (occurs in more than 10% of participants):
      1. Feeling weak or lack of energy (fatigue)
      2. Swelling or fluid retention of the face, arms, legs, or a part of the body (oedema)
      3. Pain (including back pain, neck pain, pain in the chest, muscle or bone pain, pain in arms or legs)

      1. Broken bone (fracture)
      2. Fainting due to drop in blood pressure (syncope)
      3. Weakness of the heart muscle causing decreased pumping of blood, which may cause breathing difficulty, reduced kidney function, and fluid accumulation (congestive heart failure)
      4. Dehydration
      5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged, which may mean your heart is not working normally (QT prolongation)
      6. Mood changes (Mood disorders)

      Uncommon (occurs in less than 1% of participants):
      1. Signs and symptoms from rapid breakdown of cancer cells that can occur after cancer treatment has started and can cause increased levels of blood potassium, uric acid, and phosphate, decreased levels of blood calcium, and kidney failure (Tumour lysis syndrome)
      Side effects that may be experienced when taking lansoprazole:
      1. Increased risk of diarrhoea associated with bacterial infection, especially in hospitalized participants.
      2. Bone fracture: increased risk of the hip, wrist, or spine fractures-related to osteoporosis. The risk was increased in patients who received high and long-term lansoprazole therapy. 
      3. Low magnesium in blood has been rarely reported in participants who received lansoprazole for at least 3 months, but in most cases after 1-year treatment.
      Risks associated with study procedures: 
      1. Nasogastric (NG) tube: Placing the NG tube may cause the participants to gag, and the tube may irritate the nose and throat.  The tube might cause a nosebleed.  Rarely, a serious internal injury may occur.
      2. Radiography (x-ray): This test will expose the participant to radiation. Although all radiation is cumulative over the lifetime, small doses from x-rays should not be significant.
      There may be a risk in exposing an unborn or breastfed child to a study drug, and all risks are not known at this time. Women and men must take precautions to avoid exposing an unborn child to the study drug. Participants who are pregnant, become pregnant, or are currently breastfeeding, cannot take part in this study.

TI  - A research study to investigate the safety of setanaxib and helpfulness in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN63646763
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN63646763
AB  - Background and study aims
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is a type of cancer that occurs in the outermost surface of the skin or in certain tissues within the head and neck region including the throat, mouth, sinuses, and nose. This type of cancer comes from particular cells called squamous cells which are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes (the moist lining of digestive, respiratory, reproductive, and urinary tracts). The aim of this study is to evaluate if setanaxib, a test medicine, is safe and will help in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN (i.e. cancer that has come back or spread) when combined with another medication, pembrolizumab, which is already approved and used to treat this sort of cancer. 
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged 18 years and over with SCCHN
      What does the study involve?
      Participants are randomly allocated receive setanaxib or a matching placebo (dummy tablet) in addition to the standard treatment, pembrolizumb. Participants receive pembrolizumab at 3-week intervals as an intravenous infusion (into a vein) together with setanxib or placebo as daily tablets taken by mouth for a maximum of 2 years or until the cancer gets worse or unacceptable side effects from the treatments are seen. Participants will be followed up for side effects and to monitor changes in their cancer with regular tumour scans, and tumour biopsies (samples) will also be performed. The study will consist of an up to 28-day screening period, an up to 24-month treatment period (day 1 to week 105), and a 28-day follow-up period. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      It is hoped that adding setanaxib treatment may be of benefit to the participant by giving better control of the cancer than seen after treatment with the already approved drug, pembrolizumab. However, this cannot be guaranteed. It is possible that the participants' head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may or may not respond at all or may even get worse during the study. As with any medication, it is possible that the participant could have allergic reactions to study medication, such as itching, skin rash, facial swelling, and/or a severe or sudden drop in blood pressure. A sudden drop in blood pressure could lead to shock with loss of consciousness and/or possible seizures, including the possibility of death. Participants may suffer one or more of the following at the biopsy site: pain and discomfort, tenderness and swelling, risk of bleeding, bruising and infection, or scarring. If a patient takes part in this study (assuming 24 months of treatment), they will have around 15 CT scans, have the possibility of CT-guided biopsies and may undergo other imaging procedures such as bone scans or PET scans where clinically necessary. Some of these will be extra to those that they would have if they did not take part. The radiation dose from each CT scan is about the same as they would receive from 4 to 11 years’ natural background radiation. A contrast dye will be injected into their vein and may be administered orally before their CT scan. The injected contrast may cause a slight discomfort, bruising, swelling and sometimes an allergic reaction. Severe allergic reactions (for example, a drop in blood pressure, difficulty in breathing, or kidney problems) are very rare. They may find the CT scanner mildly claustrophobic. The risk of allergic reaction to the bone and PET scan tracers is low. The participant may feel a slight discomfort at the injection site and sitting still during the test can be uncomfortable for some people. The participant will be exposed to a dose of radiation equivalent to around 1 to 7 years of natural background radiation, depending on whether bone or PET scans are necessary. These procedures use ionising radiation to form images of their body and provide their doctor with essential information about their response to treatment. Ionising radiation may cause cancer many years or decades after the exposure. In patients with their current clinical condition, the chance of this happening to them is extremely small. If participants do not like confined spaces being in the MRI scanner may make them feel uncomfortable. The MRI scanner uses strong magnets and they may not be able to have the scan if they have metallic implants. As part of the MRI scan, a contrast agent is injected into their vein. The risks associated with the contrast agent include mild nausea, headache, hives and temporary low blood pressure, although such reactions are very rare. As images are taken, a loud banging noise will be produced. Earplugs or headphones will be available if needed. The participants will be asked questions to ensure that the MRI scan is safe for them. The risks of taking blood include discomfort due to swelling or bruising around the injection site, light-headedness and fainting (uncommon) or a small risk of infection at the injection site. Participants may develop a skin rash or skin irritation where the gel and the electrodes are placed for the electrocardiogram (ECG) testing. In some cases, it may be necessary to have small patches of hair on the chest shaved to properly connect the electrodes for the ECG. There is no data from the use of setanaxib in pregnant women. It is possible that if the medicine is given to a pregnant woman it will harm the unborn child. The potential risk to a human foetus or infants of nursing mothers is unknown. Pregnant or lactating women must not participate in this study, nor should women who plan to become pregnant during the study. Male participants are advised that the effects of the study medicine on the male reproductive system are not known at this time and contraceptive methods should be used throughout the study and for 120 days after completion of the study. The information collected during this study may help the doctors and researchers to learn more about setanaxib that may benefit other people with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

TI  - Study to compare the treatment effects of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® and Pentoxifylline in patients who suffer from tinnitus for more than three months and from psychological and social problems caused by the tinnitus
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN68772788
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN68772788
AB  - Background and study aims 
      In this study we will compare the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® and a standard medication for tinnitus (Pentoxifylline) in patients suffering from tinnitus for more than 3 months with psychological and social problems caused by the tinnitus. 
      Who can participate? 
      Patients aged 40 years or older who have suffered from tinnitus for more than 3 months. 
      What does the study involve? 
      The study participants will come to the study site for four visits and in between they will be called by the investigator twice. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either the Ginkgo extract or Pentoxifylline for 3 months. The treatment effects will be measured by a tinnitus diary. The study patients document the loudness of their tinnitus and their annoyance caused by the tinnitus every day during study participation. Additionally, at the beginning, after 6 weeks of treatment and at the end of the treatment (week 12) the patients complete three questionnaires: one about the tinnitus, one about psychological complaints like depressive moods and anxiety which can be caused by tinnitus, and a third one about their general well-being. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      The benefits for the patients are a detailed tinnitus diagnostic and general examinations to exclude concurrent illnesses. The study patients receive either a standard therapy for tinnitus (Pentoxifylline), which is well established for many years in the treatment of tinnitus, or they receive an well-established herbal drug which is expected to have positive effects for example on the blood flow in the inner ear and which is known to have positive effects on psychological complaints like depressive mood or symptoms of anxiety. There are nearly no risks for the patients caused by the examinations. The main possible side effects of  the Ginkgo extract are: gastrointestinal symptoms, headache and allergic skin reactions, all usually of mild nature and quickly reversible. The main possible side effects of Pentoxifylline are gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, sensation of fullness, gastric pressure or diarrhoea (observed frequently), agitation, sleep disturbances, dizziness, tremor, headache, fever, allergic skin reactions like itching, erythema, urticaria, disturbed vision or conjunctivitis, cardiac arrhythmia  (observed occasionally), thrombocytopenia with purpura and aplastic anaemia, anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions such as angioedema, bronchospasm or anaphylactic shock, paraesthesia, convulsions, intracranial bleeding, pectoral angina or dyspnoea and increased blood pressure  (observed very rarely).

      University Hospital Prague for Ear/Nose/Throat (ENT) diseases. 
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? 
      The study is planned to start in July 2012 and is expected to run for 18 months. The recruitment of patients is planned to be completed until end of June 2013.

TI  - The effect of a multivitamin and mineral supplement on the common cold
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN68878070
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN68878070
AB  - Background and study aims
      Viral upper respiratory infections (for example colds, coughs, throat infections, influenza) can have a serious impact on health and also result in millions of days lost from employment and education. This study aims to investigate whether taking a vitamin and mineral supplement can reduce the occurrence, duration and severity of common cold symptoms.
      Who can participate?
      Adult males and females aged 18 to 65 years except those who are smokers, pregnant, breast feeding, have adverse effects to vitamins and minerals, gastrointestinal surgery, immune deficiency or suppression, inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndromes, gastrointestinal dysfunction, or current use of drugs for rheumatoid arthritis that suppress the immune system
      What does the study involve?
      Participants will randomly be divided into two groups. One group will take the "active" multivitamin and mineral supplement; the other group will take a "blank" caplet that looks identical to the active multivitamin and mineral supplement. The study will be blinded, which means that no one will know who is taking either the active or blank caplet. The study runs for 12 weeks during the months of January, February and March. Every Monday during the 12-week interval participants will receive an email requesting whether during the past week they developed symptoms of the common cold. Those who acknowledge symptoms of a cold, will be asked to answer additional questions about specific symptoms, how long they lasted and how severe their symptoms were. Responses to the email questionnaires will be maintained in a secure, confidential electronic file at the University of Washington. At the conclusion of the 12-week study period, researchers will analyze the information gathered and determine whether the multivitamin and mineral supplement meaningfully reduced the frequency, duration and severity of common cold symptoms.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Generally, side effects from vitamins and minerals are mild and unlikely if an appropriate amount is taken. In this study, the amounts of vitamins and minerals in the supplement are lower than the amounts expected to cause side effects. As with any research-stage drug, there is a possibility of unknown side effects. Throughout the study, the investigators will regularly ask participants about side effects and investigate them accordingly. Side effects will be reported to the CHI Franciscan Health Investigational Review Board/Medical Research Evaluation Committee. To avoid the possible effects of interfering substances or problems with intestinal absorption, the formula used in this study is gluten-free, free of genetic modified organisms (non-GMO),  vegetarian, nut-free, free of known interfering substances (such as citrate, glycine, tartrate, palm oil and cotton seed oil), free of artificial sweeteners. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding are not eligible to participate in this study. 
      Benefits include the potential for decreased frequency, duration and severity of the common cold during the study period. Participation could lead to improved treatments for the common cold.

TI  - Comparing coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine schedule combinations
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN69254139
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN69254139
AB  - Background and study aims
      Multiple vaccines against COVID-19 have shown efficacy on phase 3 studies, and several of these have been granted approval for use.  There are likely to be significant logistical challenges immunising large portions of the population. There would be significant advantages to having flexible immunisation programmes whereby the second vaccine dose is not necessarily the same as the first dose. 
      The main aim of this study is to determine the safety as well as the immune responses to a variety of combinations of schedules for receiving the first dose (prime) and second dose (boost) of candidate COVID-19 vaccines that will potentially be deployed in the UK. The vaccines to be studied in this protocol will primarily be determined by those made available to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for population use, and in the first instance are the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 and the Oxford/AstraZeneca ChAdOx1, with the potential to add additional vaccines at a later date.
      Furthermore, given the UK introduction of COVID-19 vaccines has utilised an extended (up to 12 weeks) interval between the first and second dose of vaccine, this study will evaluate combinations of vaccines with a 12 week, as well as 4 week, dosing interval. 
      Additional objectives of the study are to characterise COVID-19 infections experienced during the study by participants and to look at the immune response to those infections.
      Who can participate?
      Adult volunteers aged at least 50 years, including those who have other medical conditions, as long as those conditions are mild or moderate in severity and are well controlled at the time of volunteering for the study. Individuals of all ethnicities are eligible to be recruited, with the recruitment of those identifying as Black and Minority Ethnic particularly encouraged, in order to try to reflect the diversity of the UK population.
      What does the study involve?
      This trial will be studying combinations of two different vaccines. As more new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available, more vaccines may be included in the trial and so the total number of participants may increase. 
      Participants will be allocated, at random, (rather like a flip of a coin) to receive one dose of one approved vaccine and a second dose of either the same approved vaccine or a dose of a different approved vaccine. Participants will also be allocated at random to the timing of receiving these doses, some will get a boost dose four weeks after the first dose (prime) and some will get a boost after twelve weeks. 
      Between 5 and 9 routine blood tests will be taken over the course of a year to look at the immune responses to the vaccine depending on the group a participant is in. Participants may also be asked for a nasal fluid sample at each visit. Participants might also be asked to attend for a repeat blood test if there were any safety concerns. If a participant were to test positive for the virus causing COVID-19 they be asked to attend for an extra visit. Participants will also need to complete an online diary for up to 28 days following each of the two vaccinations 
      The trial will take one year to complete per participant (from the time the first dose of vaccine is given). 
      The study team will not be offering diagnostic COVID-19 testing as part of this trial, but it is important that participants in this trial access COVID-19 testing outside of the trial following normal government guidance. If a participant receives the two doses of COVID-19 vaccines in this trial, this participant will not know which two vaccines they have received until the end of the trial. Unless specifically advised by the study team, a trial participant would not be eligible to receive any further vaccine doses via the government vaccination scheme. 
      Due to changes in rules affecting national and international travel, as well as event attendance, and concerns about the disadvantage to participants from being unable to access details of their vaccination status, as of 22nd June 2021 (28 days after the last trial participant has received their boost dose) an amendment to allow the unblinding of all participants will be implemented. This will allow for recording of participants vaccination status on medical records and the NHS app. (added 18/06/2021)
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participants in this study should have a lower risk of COVID-19 disease than unimmunised individuals. Although the heterologous prime/boost schedules have not been tested or approved as yet, the UK ‘Green Book’ guide to immunisation notes that ‘as both the vaccines are based on the spike protein, it is likely the second dose will help to boost the response to the first dose’, therefore it is expected that those in the heterologous group will receive some protection (Public Health England 2020a). Participants may benefit from early receipt of an approved vaccine, should their age/risk group not be eligible for routine vaccination before the end of the trial.  
      The risks and side effects of the proposed study procedures are: 
      1. Localised bruising and discomfort associated with blood draws
      2. Localised discomfort associated with mucosal fluid sampling
      3. Possible allergic reactions to vaccines (rare but can be serious)
      4. Side effects from receiving vaccines such as pain in the vaccination site and flu-like symptoms for a short period afterwards (e.g. muscle aches and chills)
      5. There is a theoretical risk of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement, also known as Vaccine Associated Enhanced Disease. This is where having a vaccine can alter the immune response to an infection it is protecting against and make inflammation in the body worse. This has not yet been seen in any previous trials of COVID-19 vaccines but remains a theoretical risk. 
      6. Participants may alter their behaviour in relation to COVID-19 risks and precautions on the assumption that they are completely protected from the vaccines received in the trial.  Participants will be advised to follow all current COVID-19 government advice.
      7. Participants may receive unwanted media attention from participating in the trial
      8. Following reports of blood clots with lowered platelets following immunisation with the AstraZeneca vaccine a review has been undertaken by the MHRA and the EMA (European Medicines Agency). The reports were into a very rare type of blood clot in the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), and in some other organs together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) that might be associated with vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Up to and including 31 March 2021 there have been 79 UK reports of these blood clots and unfortunately 19 people died. By 31 March 2021 20.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been given in the UK. This means the overall risk of these blood clots is extremely rare, approximately 4 people in a million who receive the vaccine. All participants in this study will be provided with up-to-date information from regulators on this finding. Participants will be advised to be aware of possible signs and symptoms of blood clots and to have a low threshold to contact trial teams if experiencing these or other symptoms.
      (added 04/05/2021)
      9. There is some initial evidence from those participants boosted at 28 days, that those participants receiving different vaccines for their prime and boost doses might have some of the listed side-effects more commonly and possibly a bit more severely in the first 24 hours following vaccination. We do not know if this will be the case in participants receiving their boost dose at 84 days.
      We would like to try to find out whether there is anything that can be done to reduce these side-effects.  To do this, for participants who are due to receive their boost vaccine dose 84 days after their prime vaccine dose, there will be an option to be randomised again either to take paracetamol preventatively for the first 24 hours (with the first dose as soon as is convenient after vaccination), or to take paracetamol only if you feel you need to take it for any symptoms experienced. Dosing should be as indicated in the instructions for this over-the-counter medication and it is important not to exceed the maximum stated dose.  We would not supply you with this paracetamol, but would ask you to source it yourself.  Taking part in this sub-study is optional, and you do not have to agree.

TI  - A pneumococcal human challenge study in adults aged 50-84 years
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN71362981
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN71362981
AB  - Background and Study Aims
      The germ ‘pneumococcus’ (Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria) is a major cause of pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis around the world leading to over a million deaths per year. The biggest impact is on young children and older adults, especially in low-income countries. However, most of the information that we have about how the body responds to this infection comes from younger adults. These younger adults are less likely to develop severe infection and how they respond to bugs is different to how older adults respond. This study looks at how pneumococcus lives in the noses of older adults and causes infection. The aim is to better understand how this bug affects older people, which will hopefully help us design medication and vaccinations better for this age group.
      Over the past decade, the research group has developed innovative methods to study pneumococcus infection in healthy volunteers. People are carefully screened for safety and then infected (“challenged”) with small amounts of bacteria in their nose, which allows us to understand why some people who are exposed to the bacteria develop infection whilst others don’t. This kind of study (a “human challenge” study) can improve understanding of how bugs cause disease and is a cost-efficient way of designing and testing drugs and vaccinations. To date, over 2000 participants have been challenged with pneumococcus, including older people, demonstrating that these studies can be done safely without harm to participants. In this study, older adults will be given pneumococcus in their noses so that tests can be run to see how the bug affects them and sticks to their noses. Samples will be taken throughout the study to understand how the immune system responds to it. 
      Who can participate? 
      Healthy older adults and seniors aged 50-84 (inclusive) years old
      What does the study involve?
      All participants are screened to check they are eligible for the study and are not at high risk of infection. Following this, they will have a clinical examination and nasal and blood tests. All participants are exposed (‘challenged’) to the pneumococcus germ through drops in the nose. The study involves a further 6 in-person visits (7 visits including the initial visit above). These are spaced out over approximately 4 weeks. At these visits, participants are checked for any symptoms and will have certain nasal and blood samples taken. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participants will be a valuable part of a research study that is hoped will eventually lead to the development of new methods to prevent or treat respiratory infections. 
      Safety will be paramount in this study. Participants will have access to a study doctor 24/7 and be given backup antibiotics to take if needed. The team will work closely with participants so that they understand the study requirements and will address their questions and concerns.
      Challenge pneumococcal bacteria: Because the germ participants are exposed to is live, there is a very small risk of infection to them or their close contacts. However, the germ has been used in previous studies in older adults with no serious side effects. They may however get cold-like symptoms, headaches, earaches, a cough or a fever.
      A safety pack is provided and they will have 24-hour access to the research team by phone. This includes clear safety precautions and what to do if they feel unwell. Everyone who tests positive for the pneumococcus germ will take a course of antibiotics at the end of the study, or if they feel unwell, before that. 
      Blood sampling: The risks associated with blood sampling are minimal, but this may cause temporary pain, bruising and/or bleeding to the arm. The blood sampling will be performed by trained healthcare professionals. In the rare circumstance that anything unusual or medically significant is noticed about your blood then the team will inform them and ask their permission to inform your GP.
      Nasal sampling: There are limited risks related to these samples. During a nasal wash, you may swallow a small amount of salty water, however, this is harmless. The nasal cell sample is slightly uncomfortable and may make your eyes water briefly. Sometimes a small amount of blood can be seen on the sample probe, however, it is rare for it to cause a nosebleed. 
      Incidental medical findings
      Since several medical tests are carried out throughout the study, previously unknown health issues (e.g. high blood pressure or abnormal blood results) may be detected. This will be discussed with the participant and with their permission, their GP informed for ongoing follow-up. 
      Where is the study run from?
      The study is run by the Liverpool Vaccine Group at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool, UK. We have been studying lung infections using healthy volunteers for over ten years to provide world-leading research into the pneumococcus germ using methods called an Experimental Human Pneumococcal Challenge (EHPC) model. More than 2000 participants have already been safely studied using our methods, including older adults. 
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?
      October 2023 to August 2024

TI  - Effects of treatment for vestibular schwannoma on hearing function
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN72586805
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN72586805
AB  - Background and study aims:
      Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are non-cancerous tumours that grow on the hearing and balance nerve. These tumours can cause problems such as hearing loss, ringing or other noises in the head (tinnitus) and loss of balance. Treatment options for VS depend on tumour size and how fast it is growing. Small tumours are usually monitored using MRI scans (i.e., ‘watch and wait’). Surgery may be needed to remove a large tumour or treat one that is growing. One type of treatment, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), uses a precise beam of radiation to arrest tumour growth. The ‘watch and wait’ treatment option presents a risk to hearing function as hearing often continues to deteriorate in the affected ear, even without obvious tumour growth. Some research studies suggest that stereotactic radiosurgery used at the time of tumour diagnosis, might delay hearing ability decline but the evidence is unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the viability of monitoring hearing function in people being managed for VS. The researchers want to understand which hearing function tests are best to evaluate the potential benefits of SRS compared with ‘watch and wait’. They also aim to measure the reliability of the hearing tests over time.
      Who can participate?:
      Patients between 30 and 65 years of age who have a sporadic vestibular schwannoma and are either undergoing follow-up with serial MRI scans or are being considered for/have undergone treatment with SRS
      What does the study involve?
      At the testing session the researchers will carry out five hearing tests and complete two questionnaires.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Overall the results of this feasibility study will be used to help us better understand hearing loss in VS and answer an important question. Taking part in this study will not disadvantage participant's usual treatment in any way. All the hearing tests being used in this study are accepted clinical tools and there is minimal-to-no-excess risk to participants taking part in this study.

TI  - Evaluating COVID-19 Vaccination Boosters
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN73765130
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN73765130
AB  - Background and study aims
      COVID-19 is a condition caused by the coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in late 2019. This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.
      Vaccinations against COVID-19 have successfully been rolled out across the UK, with the majority of people having been vaccinated with either the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOx1-nCov19) or the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2). With the emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 and the waning of immunity over time, it is likely that seasonal booster vaccinations may be required for high-risk groups. This study is to evaluate which booster vaccinations provide the best immune response, depending on which initial vaccination was used for the first 2 doses (known as a "prime-boost" regime).
      Who can participate?
      This study will enrol healthy adult volunteers aged 30 years or older from the JCVI priority groups 1 - 3 who received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccination in December 2020 or January 2021 who are at least 84 days post their second vaccination. Volunteers who are 70 days post second vaccine with Oxford/AstraZeneca may also be allowed to participate, due to differences in the roll out of vaccines in the NHS.
      What does the study involve?
      The study has 3 groups (A, B, and C) that are allocated to different sites which are running the study. Participants within groups A and B will be allocated to receive either one of 3 COVID-19 vaccines or a control group which will receive the Men ACWY vaccine (this protects against the Meningococcal bacteria which causes sepsis and meningitis). Participants in group B will be allocated to receive either one of 4 COVID-19 vaccines or a control group which will receive the Men ACWY vaccine.
      Participants will be randomly allocated with an equal chance of receiving each of the vaccines (like tossing a coin). Group A will either receive Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax, Novavax half dose, or Men ACWY. Group B will either receive Pfizer, Valneva, Valneva half dose, Janssen, or Men ACWY. Group C will either receive Moderna, Curevac, Pfizer half dose, or Men ACWY
      Participants will have a screening visit performed over the phone, then attend a screening and vaccination visit in person. They will have a medical review and blood tests for baseline immunity and safety. They will then receive their allocated vaccine. The participant will not know which vaccine they have received. They will wait 15 min after their vaccine to ensure they have no acute reaction. Following this participants will complete a diary of their symptoms for 28 days.
      Participants will attend follow up visits at 28, 84 and 365 days after their vaccination to have blood tests to check their immune response. A subset of 25 participants from each vaccine group will be in the "Immunology" cohort, who will attend additional visits on days 7 and 14 for extra blood tests, and they will also provide samples of saliva and nasal fluid at the regular visits.
      If participants receive a positive PCR swab for COVID-19 during the study, they will be asked to contact the study team and attend an extra visit where they will have a swab for COVID-19 with the study team as well as additional blood samples to check their immune response to the virus.
      After the NHS announced a national booster campaign and all participants completed their day 84 follow up visits, the participants allocated to the control arm were unblinded (other participants were informed they received an active vaccine, but not which one) and invited to be re-randomised to receive one of three COVID-19 vaccines as a booster: either Pfizer, a half dose of Pfizer, or a half dose of Moderna. This will allow us to compare the immune response of people who received a third dose booster approximately 3 months after their primary course of immunisation to the participants who received their boosters approximately 6 months after their primary course of immunisation.
      There are several additional sub-studies of COV-BOOST
      We have also invited participants of the Novavax clinical trial who received 2 doses the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine to receive a 3rd dose booster vaccine with Pfizer as part of the COV-BOOST study to monitor for side effects, and to see whether giving a different booster effects the immune response to this type of vaccine.
      Participants who received the Pfizer vaccine as their third dose booster vaccine as part of the COV-BOOST study have been invted to participate in a fourth dose booster sub-study, where they will be randomised to receive either a fourth dose of the Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna vaccine, at a half dose (the same dose deployed as a third dose booster in the NHS). Participants will be followed up for a further 3 months to check for side effects and their immune response.
      Young adults aged 18 – 30 who have not yet received a third dose booster have been invited to participate in our young adult fractional dosing sub-study. They will be randomised to received either a full dose of the Pfizer vaccine, a dose of one third of the Pfizer vaccine (the same as is administered to children aged 5 – 11 years), a half dose of the Moderna vaccine (the same as administered as a third dose booster via the NHS to adults) or a dose of one quarter of the Moderna vaccine. This study is to determine whether lower doses of these vaccines when given to young adults might have as good, or nearly as good an immune response as higher doses, and may have fewer side effects. Participants will be followed up for 8 months in 5 visits to check for side effects and their immune response.
      Following the emergence of the Omicron variant, companies have produced vaccines which have been modified with the aim of training the immune system to target this variant more effectively than previous vaccines. COV-BOOST will undertake 2 sub studies containing variant adapted vaccines.
      As part of the Omicron variant sub-study, we invited healthy adults who had received their third dose booster more than 84 days prior to be randomised to either a fourth dose booster with Moderna’s Omicron variant vaccine, or a fourth dose of the Pfizer vaccine. We will follow participants up and check their immune responses against both the Omicron and Delta variant to see which produces the best immune response, and if there is any difference between the two. As it is a new vaccine, we will also be carefully monitoring participants for side effects. The follow up will be 5 visits over 8 months.
      As part of the Omicron Bivalent sub-study, we invited healthy adults who had received their third dose booster more than 84 days prior to be randomised to either a fourth dose booster with Moderna’s Bivalent vaccine, containing both the original and their updated Omicron mRNA, or a fourth dose of the Pfizer vaccine. We will follow participants up and check their immune responses against both the Omicron and Delta variant to see which produces the best immune response, and if there is any difference between the two. As it is a new vaccine, we will also be carefully monitoring participants for side effects. The follow up will be 5 visits over 8 months.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Administration of the third dose ‘boost’ of COVID-19 vaccine in this study (from 84 days after the second dose) may be administered earlier than it would be through routine immunisation, which is of potential benefit. This would not be the case for those who receive the MenACWY control vaccine.
      It is hoped that the information gained from this study will contribute to the development of a safe, effective, and versatile vaccine programme against COVID-19.
      The risks of participating are as follows:
      Drawing blood may cause slight pain and occasionally bruising at the site where the needle enters. Some people feel light-headed or even faint when having blood taken. During the course of the trial we will need to take between 30 ml and 77 ml of blood at a single visit. The total amount we will take over the period of the trial will be (approximately) 214-264ml if you are in the general cohort, or (approximately) 330-381 ml if you are in the immunology cohort. An additional 57-77 ml would be taken at the COVID-19 pathway visit if you were to develop confirmed COVID-19 during the study. If repeat bloods are requested for safety reasons at a visit this will be up to 7ml. These amounts over the course of the year, should be below the limit of 470 ml every 3-4 months for blood donations to the National Blood Transfusion Service.
      If abnormal results or undiagnosed conditions are found during the course of the trial these will be discussed with you and, if you agree, your GP (or a hospital specialist, if more appropriate) will be informed. Any newly diagnosed conditions will be looked after within the NHS. Participants will not be informed of the results of their levels of post-vaccine immunity against the COVID-19 virus as these are not clinically validated tests.
      Nasal fluid samples (optional) will involve insertion of a small bit of soft synthetic material about 2cm into your nostril and leaving it in there, pressed up against the inside of your nose for about one min. This can cause some eye-watering, but should not cause any damage to your nostrils. Some people might have more sensitive nostril linings and this might rarely cause a small amount of bleeding.
      We aim to collect 1-1.5 ml saliva using a funnel and collection tube. Participants may find the saliva collection process unsavoury as it is involves drooling and spitting into a collection device. If you are having nasal fluid samples taken, we may also ask for optional saliva samples at routine visits from 28 days after your first vaccine dose. We would ask participants who are giving saliva samples not to eat, drink, smoke, chew gum, brush their teeth or use mouthwash for at least 30 min prior to their appointment.
      Common side effects of vaccination are as follows:
      1. People very often have tenderness, pain, warmth, redness, itching, swelling, or bruising, or less commonly have a small lump in their arm where they have been vaccinated
      2. The symptoms of fatigue, headaches, flu-like symptoms (such as high temperature, sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills), muscle aches, joint aches, feeling unwell (malaise), and feeling sick or nauseated or vomiting can develop after vaccination and usually last for less than a week after vaccination (more commonly 24-48 h afterwards).
      Other less common side effects include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, feeling dizzy, swollen lymph nodes (glands), and excessive sweating, itching skin or rash. These symptoms can be reduced by use of paracetamol around the time of immunisation and over the next 24 h. We would not routinely recommend the use of ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory medication at this time.
      After immunisation with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine, difficulty sleeping has been observed in fewer than 1 in 100 people, and weakness of the muscles on one side of the face has been observed in fewer than 1 in 1000 people.
      Data from studies comparing mixed prime-boost regimes of COVID-19 vaccination (e.g. Oxford/AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer) have found this may increase the risk of side effects following the second vaccine. It is possible that receiving a COVID-19 booster vaccine in this study which is different to your original prime-boost regime, this might increase the side effects of following vaccination.
      With any vaccination, there is a small risk of rare serious adverse events, such as an allergic reaction. These may be related to the immune system or to the nervous system. Severe allergic reactions to vaccines (anaphylaxis) are rare (approximately 1 per million vaccine doses), but can be fatal. In case of this unlikely event, medication for treating allergic reactions is available and the researchers are appropriately trained in the management of anaphylaxis.
      These are new vaccines, and there may be side effects that we are not yet aware of. Further information about vaccine safety is being actively gathered as the vaccines are being used in the UK and globally. participants will be informed of any significant change in the vaccine safety profile.
      Participants will be provided with a 24 h trial mobile number. If they experience unexpected events or become in any way concerned they can use this to contact one of the trial doctors at any time. We will ask you them record these symptoms in the e-diary too.
      Recently there have been reports of a very rare condition involving blood clots and unusual bleeding after vaccination. This is being carefully reviewed but the risk factors for this condition are not yet clear. Although this condition remains extremely rare there appears to be a higher risk in people shortly after the first dose of the AstraZeneca (AZ) or Janssen vaccine. Around 4 people develop this condition for every million doses of AZ vaccine doses given. This is seen slightly more often in younger people and tends to occur between 4 days and 2 weeks following vaccination. This condition can also occur naturally, and clotting problems are a common complication of COVID-19 infection. An increased risk has not yet been seen after other COVID-19 vaccines but is being carefully monitored. We do not know whether the risk of clots following vaccination with the Oxford/AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccine will be affected by receiving the first dose after already having had 2 doses of a different COVID-19 vaccine.
      In the past, experimental vaccines were developed by different research groups against the SARS virus, which is in the same family as the COVID-19 virus and also infects the lungs. In some cases, animals that received certain types of experimental SARS vaccines appeared to develop more severe lung inflammation when they were later infected with SARS compared with unvaccinated animals. There has also been one report of this increased disease-associated inflammation being seen in a mouse study for a vaccine against MERS-CoV (another related virus), but this has not been observed in any other reported animal studies, and has not been seen in any of the trials of the vaccines being used in this trial. Importantly, this has not been seen in any of the human studies of these vaccines, which have shown immunisation with the vaccines used in this trial does provide protection against COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Background and study aims
      The number of spinal surgeries has increased significantly during the last 10 years. There are important benefits of instrumented spinal surgery such as prevention of neurological deficits, pain relief, improved physical function, quality of life and patient satisfaction. Unfortunately, these benefits are to some degree negatively balanced by re-operations needed due to post-operative infections. A postoperative wound infection is associated with increased patient suffering, illness, side effects of antimicrobial treatment, vacuum-assisted wound therapy as well as increased risk of destabilization of the spine, pain and disability. The high dose and long course of resistance-driving antibiotics often used in the treatment of implant infections contribute to the overall burden of hard-to-treat microbes. Thus, the overarching and long-term aim of this study is to generate the necessary knowledge needed to reduce the rate of infections and subsequent reoperations in patients undergoing spinal surgery with implants. 
      Who can participate?
      Patients at the study hospital undergoing primary spinal implant surgery from the age of 10 years
      What does the study involve?
      This is an observational study meaning that there will be no changes in standard care. The difference from standard care involves the collection of patient-related data and the sample of bacteria from the nose, skin and surgical wound as well as blood samples. The data will be used for understanding the most important risk factors associated with a post-operative infection.  
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      There are no risks or benefits associated with participating.

AB  - Background and study aims
      Biological clocks regulate how our body works, and they must synchronize to our 24-hour world. Environmental timing cues feed into a ‘master clock’ in the brain, which then synchronizes clocks throughout the body. Light-dark cycles, meal times, and steroid hormones form the strongest cues, tuning our internal clocks to the day-night rhythm. Genetic variation determines how our body clocks align with this rhythm, thus resulting in different ‘chronotypes’ (i.e. ‘morning larks’ and ‘night owls’).
      Annually, millions of people stretch the limits of their body clock by rapidly crossing multiple time zones. Temporary misalignment between an individual’s body clock and local time in their destination produces ‘jet lag’, the symptoms of which subside as the body clock adapts to the new time zone. Disruption of our body clocks—as occurs with jet lag and shift work—has far-reaching health effects, playing a role in cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and dementia. If we could rapidly reset the body clock to better accommodate our modern lifestyles, this could have enormous health benefits. 
      An intense challenge is faced by visitors to high altitude, since exposure to a low-oxygen environment often coincides with jet lag. A prominent feature of both jet lag and ascent to high altitude is sleep disturbance. Most studies of sleep at altitude have failed to control for individual chronotype and body clock function—factors which could substantially modify the body’s adaptation to a new time zone. Research on APEX 6 addresses an important knowledge gap; the impact of individual chronotype and jet lag on how the body copes with high altitude. The RESET trial builds on this by testing whether a multi-factorial intervention can accelerate resetting of body clocks and improve sleep function in healthy volunteers exposed to jet lag and high altitude. 
      Who can participate?
      We will recruit 35 healthy volunteers (males and females, aged 18-25 years); all participants will be recruited from the cohort of volunteers taking part in the APEX 6 expedition to the Bolivian Andes. People who smoke or who have significant disease of their heart or their lungs will not be able to participate. 
      What does the study involve?
      The RESET trial is an extension of research being conducted into body clocks at high altitude during the APEX 6 expedition. Taking part in the trial means that, after baseline testing, the volunteer will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention sequences, and will receive the RESET intervention on either the outbound or return leg of travel to South America. To measure body clock function throughout the expedition, volunteers will be asked to wear an activity wristband (like a ‘fit bit’) before, during, and after the expedition (total 25 days). Volunteers may also have the opportunity to use ingestible core body temperature monitoring ‘pills’ on days 1, 4 and 10 of the expedition. 
      The RESET intervention will last 72 hours and consists of five components, each optimally timed to promote rapid resetting of the body clock to the new time zone. Components include restrictions on the timing of (1) exposure to light, (2) food consumption, (3) physical exertion, and (4) sleep opportunity, and (5) a single, oral dose of synthetic steroid (dexamethasone) to suppress the volunteers ‘stress’ axis and thus reset their internal rhythm of steroid hormone. Exact timings will be determined by each volunteer's flight schedule and chronotype.
      Volunteers will be asked to complete questionnaires in the lead up to, and each day during the expedition. These will document their chronotype, sleep patterns, sleep quality, mood, cognition and any symptoms of altitude sickness.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The RESET intervention may offer direct benefits to volunteers (i.e. faster resetting of the body clock, reduction in jet lag symptoms, improvements in sleep function or other parameters on exposure to high altitude). Beyond general risks associated with travel to South America and high altitude, there are risks specifically associated with taking part in the RESET trial:
      Activity wristband
      1.Skin irritation (allergic contact dermatitis); an extremely unlikely adverse reaction to wearing the device
      Core body temperature pill
      2. Worsening of pre-existing, undiagnosed gut problems. 
      3. Incompatibility with advanced imaging (such as MRI scans). If emergency evacuation could result in an MRI scan (extremely unlikely), the need for caution will be communicated to the clinical team.
      Steroid (dexamethasone) treatment
      4. There are some medical conditions for which dexamethasone would present a risk; these are listed as specific exclusion criteria for the trial. Some drugs might interact with dexamethasone; the need to use such substances would exclude a volunteer from the dexamethasone element of the intervention. The most common side effects of dexamethasone (very unlikely following a single dose) include gut problems such as a stomach ulcer. A stomach protectant (omeprazole) is included with the intervention. 
      Where is the study run from?
      Sea-level data collection will take place in the UK (mainly the University of Edinburgh). Most data collection in Bolivia will be conducted at a high altitude field laboratory (4800m); a small amount will be conducted in La Paz. The RESET intervention will take place either during the outbound or the return leg of travel to South America.
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?
      September 2019 to September 2022
      Who is funding the study?
      The RESET trial is being organised by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, the University of Sheffield, and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge. It is being funded from a variety of sources including the Wilderness Medical Society and the Altitude Physiology Expeditions (APEX) charity. The trial is co-sponsored by the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian (UK).

AB  - Background and study aims
      Lung cancer kills more people worldwide than any other malignancy. Currently 33,500 individuals die each year in the UK from lung cancer. The number of deaths has fallen in the past years and this is likely to be due to a decline in tobacco smoking and possibly greater public awareness. However, there is now a large ex-smoking population in the USA and Europe who remain at high risk of developing lung cancer, which is dependent on how long they smoked. This group of individuals now exceeds current smokers in both the USA and Europe and will continue to do so over the next two to three decades. Screening to detect the disease before patients develop any symptoms is a control measure urgently requiring evaluation, as surgery at an early stage of the disease remains the only realistic option for a cure. The aim of the UKLS study is to assess whether low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening and treatment of early lesions decreases lung cancer mortality compared to a control group without screening. 
      Who can participate?
      The UKLS pilot trial aims to recruit 4000 men and women aged 50 to 75. 
      What does the study involve?
      An initial mailing will be sent out to 250,000 individuals containing a patient information leaflet, first questionnaire, refusal to participate questionnaire, and a prepaid envelope to allow the documents to be returned.  Eligible participants will receive a second invitation letter, including a more detailed participant information booklet, a further questionnaire, a refusal to participate questionnaire and a prepaid envelope. The second questionnaire includes a section for the individual to sign to indicate they are happy to be contacted by the UKLS team so that a recruitment appointment can be booked for them. At the recruitment appointment,  recruits in groups of 6-8 individuals will be shown a UKLS Information DVD which provides a background to the UKLS trial. The research nurse will hold a group discussion to answer general questions. The participant will then go to a separate clinic room, where they will meet with the UKLS research nurse to confirm eligibility for the study and to discuss any outstanding issues in detail. The participant has the opportunity to ask questions at this stage. If an individual agrees to participate, fully informed written consent to participate in the UKLS study will be taken by the UKLS research nurse. The UKLS research nurse will then perform a lung function test. Blood samples (up to 24 ml), buccal (cheek) swabs, nasal brushings and samples of sputum (a thick fluid produced in the lungs) will be taken. The participant will then be asked to complete a questionnaire on a touch screen computer. Assistance will be provided to the participants on how to complete the questionnaire. About 2 weeks after the clinic visit, participants will be told whether they have been randomly allocated to either the CT scan group or the non-CT scan group. All smokers will be provided with smoking cessation advice sheets and a list of local NHS Stop Smoking services. Participants allocated to the CT scan arm will attend an appointment to undergo a CT scan of the chest. Participants needing a 3- or 12-month repeat scan are contacted by the UKLS to book the appointment at the appropriate time. Two weeks after receiving the scan results the participants will receive a questionnaire in the post to be completed and returned to the UKLS team. Participants allocated to the non-CT scan group will receive a questionnaire two weeks after allocation. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participating in the screening may cause anxiety, for example when awaiting the outcome of the CT screen and for those who require follow-up CT screens. In order to reduce this anxiety, we will provide an informative patient information leaflet, further information on our UKLS website and also a telephone number for anxious patients to call. The research nurse will be available at each afternoon session to answer calls or make appointments to see anxious patients. If a patient is extremely anxious the respiratory consultant will provide an appointment to see these individuals. In such cases we will also inform the participant's GP of their concerns, in order that they may have further support. 
      Participants may be concerned about the exposure to radiation from a CT scan. The amount of radiation delivered by one low-dose CT scan of the chest to a standard-sized adult is about 1 mSv (in clinical practice a routine chest CT examination may be up to 10 mSv). 1 mSv is equivalent to about 5 months' worth of natural background radiation. The International Committee on Radiological Protection advises that there may be a small chance that low amounts of radiation may cause cell damage that will manifest itself as cancer many years after the exposure. In the UKLS the radiation dose will almost invariably be less than 1 mSv. The risk of cancer induction for one low-dose CT scan is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 for a healthy 50-year-old (this is additional to the lifetime likelihood of developing cancer of about 1 in 4). We will make the above information clear to all potential participants during the consent process.
      Diagnostic work-up may cause anxiety in participants. The great majority of suspicious nodules will not grow and will be regarded as benign. This will be made clear to subjects recalled for additional investigation. The detection of such nodules is an unavoidable part of the screening programme. The patient information leaflet will provide a detailed explanation of why follow-up CT is needed in a relatively high proportion of subjects and the associated risks. Early results from other screening trials have indicated that clinical work-up will only occur in a very small proportion of the CT screened population (estimated at 1.5%, of which 70% will have lung cancer). The proportion of subjects that undergo these tests is kept low by ensuring that subjects are filtered by less invasive tests (repeat CT) until the probability of malignancy is sufficiently high to warrant invasive tests or resection. 
      Where is the study run from?
      The study will be co-ordinated by the Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit, University of Liverpool.  The recruiting hospitals will be Liverpool Heart & Chest Hospital and Papworth Hospital in Cambridge.
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?

TI  - The first-in-human trial of MDX-124 in patients with advanced cancer
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN78740398
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN78740398
AB  - https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-looking-at-mdx-124-for-solid-tumours-that-have-spread-attainment
      Background and study aims
      The aim of this study is to find an effective dose of the study drug (MDX-124) for future studies. The research will look at how safe and well the body copes with the drug before any severe side effects appear (tolerability) and examine how this drug may work with existing forms of treatment available. 
      The study drug is a molecule involved within the immune system that can specifically bind to a target and activate an immune response (antibody). These antibodies are based on human antibodies (humanised) and have been changed to specifically target a protein called annexin-A1 (ANXA1). All antibodies used will be exactly the same (monoclonal). These are referred to as humanised monoclonal antibodies. The study drug binds to a protein produced by humans and animals called ANXA1. 
      ANXA1 is a protein produced by various organs in the human body and has several normal functions, but when overproduced is known to play a critical role in how certain cancers behave.
      Who can participate?
      Adults with solid tumours
      What does the study involve?
      This is the first clinical trial to use the study drug in humans. There are 2 sections (or modules). In Module 1 a set dose of the study drug will be given to each participant every 14 days. Dosing will continue until cancer progresses as indicated by an increase in tumour size and/or the identification of new tumours. Dosing may stop if the participant does not feel well enough to continue or if the doctor decides the participant should stop the study. Depending on the information on how well that dose works it is possible that the dose will be increased in the next joining participant. It is expected that 24 participants will join Module 1 of the study to find the effective dose of MDX-124. Module 2 will involve using the information on safe and effective doses gained from Module 1 to determine how the study drug works in combination with chemotherapies. Module 2 will recruit 20 more participants.
      The results will be used to improve treatments for patients with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic cancers. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Participants may derive clinical benefits following treatment with the study drug (MDX-124), which is not currently available other than via participation in the trial. Participants will receive increased medical care (including blood tests and scans) as part of participation in the trial.  
      Participation in the study will enable the potential benefits and side effects of MDX-124 to be assessed which will then inform future research.
      To date, there is limited knowledge of MDX-124's safety profile in humans. The study has been designed to mirror the treatment and clinical assessments carried out as part of the standard of care in this group of patients. In addition, as this is a first-in-human study additional cytokine and immunophenotyping lab tests have been included in the schedule of events.
      There are 4 main areas where there may be an increase in the risk/burden on the trial subjects:
      1. Administration of MDX-124
      2. Taking part in sample collection
      3. Informed consent
      4. Radiation exposure when receiving scans
      The following precautionary measures have been put in place:
      1. Assessment of full blood count, renal function and liver function will be made prior to each administration of MDX-124
      2. The occurrence of toxicity including haematological toxicity which requires dose adjustment will be specified in the protocol
      3. The effect of exposure to MDX-124 in patients with renal impairment is not known. Therefore, trial entry is restricted to patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥50 ml/min/1.73m2.
      4. MDX-124 should not be administered to pregnant women. A negative pregnancy test should be confirmed before the administration of MDX-124 for all women of childbearing age.
      5. Subjects will be asked to remain at the site for 6 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 in order for them to be observed by study staff.
      6. There is no known antidote for MDX-124 and treatment of AEs associated with its use should be for the underlying adverse symptoms
      7. Since MDX-124 will be prepared in specialist oncology pharmacies and administered by experienced chemotherapy-trained nurses via intravenous infusion, overdose is considered to be highly unlikely. There is no specific treatment for an overdose of MDX-124. In case of overdose, therapy may be interrupted and any adverse reactions treated symptomatically.
      Risks of taking part in blood or biopsy sample collection:
      Plasma and serum will be taken prior to the start of treatment and at every dosing visit of every cycle. In addition, blood samples will be collected for PK, annexin-A1, cytokine, immunophenotyping, tumour marker and immunogenicity analysis.
      When the needle is inserted to draw the blood the patients may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation and afterwards there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. 
      In total 24 samples will be collected for PK. This will require subjects to remain at the site for 6 hours after receiving administration of MDX-124 on 2 separate days and having to return to the site on no treatment days for sample collection.
      Tissue collection is not compulsory as part of the study, patients can either agree or disagree to take part. Complications with biopsies are uncommon. In a small number of cases, there may be some bleeding from the biopsy site. This is usually minor and soon stops. There is also a risk of inflammation at the site of the biopsy but again this is rare. There is a slight risk that the small wound will become infected by the biopsy.
      In this study, scans will be used to determine efficacy but as this is a first-in-human study the scans are included primarily for patient safety as they will be used to identify disease progression. The study proposes to use CT scans which will expose the patients to radiation which is potentially harmful. Oncology patients undergo routine CT and MRI scans in order to monitor disease status. The oncology patients who will be enrolled in this study have an unmet medical need which needs to be taken into consideration when assessing the risk of radiation exposure. As a result, the scanning frequency of every 8 weeks has been selected for this trial as this strikes an appropriate balance between standard of care and providing safety oversight of the patients.  
      Some CT scans may need special preparation beforehand, called contrast medium. Iodinated contrast is generally safe. At the time of administration patients may:
      1. Feel hot and flushed for a minute or two
      2. Have a metallic taste in the mouth
      3. Feel like they are passing urine but they aren’t – this feeling is common and passes quickly
      Rarely people have an allergic reaction to the contrast medium. This most often starts with weakness, sweating and difficulty breathing. The radiographer will ask for any allergies before the contrast medium is administered.
      Patients might get a small bruise around the area where they put the needle in.
      There's a risk that the contrast medium will leak outside the vein. This can cause swelling and pain in the hand or arm but it’s rare.
      There is a small risk that the contrast medium can affect the kidneys. The radiographer will check the most recent blood test results before the scan to make sure the kidneys are working well. 
      The study is only to be conducted at hospitals with expertise in the treatment and diagnosis of advanced cancer to ensure the highest standard of care for the patients.

UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN81020233
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN81020233
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer due to diagnosis after it has spread. If diagnosed early, before spread, then curative treatment can be offered. Screening programs using CT scans can diagnose lung cancer early and save lives, but they are expensive and can only be applied to people at the very highest risk, which represents less than 40% of people with lung cancer.
      Exhalation technology have a device (Inflammacheck) that detects hydrogen peroxide in exhaled breath, which has previously been suggested to be raised in the breath of people who have lung cancer. This is a pilot study that will test whether the inflammacheck device can distinguish lung cancer cases from controls. 
      Who can participate? 
      People aged 18 years and over participating in lung health checks or who have been diagnosed with lung cancer but have not started treatment yet.
      What does the study involve? 
      Breathing into two devices (3 minutes each) at a single visit. Briefly, the researchers will recruit 20 people with lung cancer and 20 non-cancer controls who will breathe into the Inflammacheck device where hydrogen peroxide will be measured. They will screen other exhaled compounds to determine if any other biomarkers emerge that are associated with lung cancer and can increase the performance of Inflammacheck.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      There is no direct personal benefit from taking part - this is not a validated test yet so results will not inform treatment decisions. However, participating will help to develop this test so that people in the future may benefit. Risks include minor discomfort from wearing a nose clip and breathing into the device.

PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN85107274
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN85107274
AB  - Background and study aims
      The introduction of dental implants as an option to replace missing teeth is considered one of the most revolutionary developments in modern dentistry. One of the key aspects for these implants to be successful is to have an aesthetic tooth on top that blends harmoniously with the neighbouring teeth. The material used for this prosthetic tooth is of the utmost importance to achieve the desired aesthetic result. However, the wide variety of existing materials and the lack of solid evidence to guide the clinician’s choice is reported as one of the main challenges to overcome. Based on this, the aim of this study is to compare three types of materials to fabricate prosthetic teeth over implants.
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged over 19 years requiring single tooth extraction in the upper anterior and premolar region of the mouth
      What does the study involve?
      Participants are randomly allocated to receive a metal-porcelain implant tooth, an E-max implant tooth or a zirconium implant tooth to replace the missing one. The success of these restorations is evaluated at 12 months. 
      What are the possible risks and benefits of participating?
      The main benefit of this study is providing the participants with a dental implant to replace a missing tooth instead of another treatment that would not suit their needs or may have a negative impact on neighbouring teeth, such as a fixed dental prosthesis. The potential risks associated with this treatment are mainly associated with the minor surgical procedure needed to place a dental implant and the unlikely scenario in which a dental implant failed. The main risks are listed below:
      Swelling of the lips, chin, cheeks, and other tissues of the face, mouth, and neck with possible bruising and discoloration. Damage to and possible loss of other teeth, fillings, or other dental work, which will require root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or new fillings or restorations. Infection which will require antibiotic treatment, possibly further surgery, and may lead to loss of the implant. Discomfort which may require the use of pain medication for several days or longer, and which will also require at-home recuperation for the same period of time or longer. Bleeding which may be prolonged or heavy, and may require additional surgery or other treatment. Sinus or nasal problems, including but not limited to nasal stuffiness, bleeding, infection, or creation of an opening between the nose or sinus and mouth, which may require surgery. Poor healing of the gum tissue which may result in exposure of the implant and its loss. Loss or resorption of the bone which may result in failure of the implant. Injury of the nerves near the treatment site which causes pain, numbness, or tingling of the lips or areas of the face. This effect is usually temporary but may be permanent. Stretching or damage to the corners of the mouth with cracking, bleeding, and bruising.

AB  - Background and study aims 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease which affects 10% of people over 65 rising to 40% of those over 85 years, and is a major global healthcare burden. About 820,000 people in the UK and almost 35 million people worldwide live with dementia. Dementia costs the UK economy £23 billion per year, and US$604 billion worldwide. Liraglutide  is already licensed for the treatment of diabetes and has shown promising results in studies carried out in animal models for AD.  The aim of this study is to assess the  safety and effectiveness of liraglutide in people with AD.   
      Who can participate?
      Men and women aged between 50-85 years and diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
       
      What does the study involve?
      Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either liraglutide or an identical matching placebo (dummy). Brain scans of all patients will be performed at the Imperial College Clinical Imaging Facility (Hammersmith Campus) at the start of the study and after 12 months treatment with liraglutide or placebo. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      Not provided at time of registration.
      Where is the study run from?
      The study is led by Imperial College London and will be conducted at five major universities/sites in the UK.

AB  - Background and study aims
      Asthma is a common lung condition affecting 5-10% of adults in the UK. It is severe in about 10% of sufferers where patients have considerable symptoms despite appropriate treatment. Although we know quite a lot about asthma there is still a big gap in our basic knowledge of asthma especially with regards to the causes and mechanisms of the microscopic structural changes seen in the lungs of people suffering from asthma.  Bronchial thermoplasty is a new treatment for patients with severe asthma. The technique uses radio waves that heat the lining of the lungs, destroying some of the muscle tissue that constricts (gets narrower) during an asthma attack. This has been proven to improve asthma control and asthma-related quality of life and has also been shown to reduce severe asthma exacerbations (when a patient has worsening of asthma symptoms) and also reduce hospital admissions. This study is investigating how the lung restores and repairs itself after thermoplasty, exploring the role of different cells in the process. We are hoping this will improve our understanding of the different changes seen in asthma and may help in developing new asthma treatments in the future. 
      Who can participate?
      The study will recruit patients with asthma who are undergoing bronchial thermoplasty as part of their normal clinical care in various participating centres in the UK.  
      What does the study involve?
      Each recruited participant will be involved in the study for about 6 months. Some of the visits and investigations would be undertaken as part of the standard clinical thermoplasty procedure that the  participant has been scheduled for by the clinical team. Please see below for a visit by visit description.
      Visit 1
      The first visit will confirm if the patient wishes to take part and is suitable for the study, followed by a brief medical review and medical history. The participant will be asked to sign a consent form.
      Visit 2 
      The participant will come into the research unit in the week before the scheduled clinical thermoplasty procedure to have some breathing tests, a sputum (phlegm and saliva) sample, a blood sample and some health questionnaires for research purposes. They will also undergo certain tests that are part of the normal pre-assessment visit as per normal clinical care. The participant will also be asked if you would be willing to have an Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that will involve a separate visit in the same week.  The MRI scan is optional and the participant can opt out when signing the consent form. This visit will therefore take place over 3 separate days with the bronchial thermoplasty session being performed on the last day. During the participant thermoplasty procedure we would take samples from the lungs, this is also optional.
      Visit 3 & 4
      Visit 3 and 4 are the same. The participant comes into the research unit the week before  the scheduled clinical thermoplasty procedure to have some breathing tests and a blood sample only. The participant will not have a repeat computerised tomography (CT) scan or MRI on these two visits. Therefore this visit will take place over 2 separate days with the bronchial thermoplasty session being performed on the last day.
      Visit 5
      This visit will involve two visits to the research unit. The first visit will involve breathing tests, CT scan, blood sample, sputum sample and health questionnaires. The second visit, if the participant wishes to do it, will be to have an MRI scan.  
      Visit 6
      This visit will involve one visit to the research unit where the participant will have breathing tests, sputum sample and health questionnaires.
      About the tests:
      Blood Tests
      A blood sample will be taken for safety measures as part of your pre-assessment visit. The research team will also take some blood for research and will look at cells that might be contributing to the healing process in asthma and will also look at the genetics specific to airways disease and not your personal genetics.  In addition to the clinical care safety bloods the researchers will take a maximum of 50 ml per visit. This is equivalent to approximately 3 tablespoons.    
      Spirometry 
      This will involve breathing out as hard as possible several times, repeated once more after inhaling Ventolin (medicine used to treat/prevent asthma). The participant will most likely have had this test done before.  This may cause some temporary light headedness and coughing.
      Lung Function Testing
      As part of the research the researchers would like to do further breathing tests on lung function. These tests involve breathing in safe gas mixtures and blowing tests to measure the irritation in your lungs. One breathing test is carried out sitting in a transparent glass booth. The breathing tests may cause some temporary light headedness and coughing. 
      Bronchial thermoplasty 
      The clinical team will have discussed with the participant about having bronchial thermoplasty as part of managing your asthma and will have talked through the procedure and associated risks. In summary, the participant will be having three sessions of thermoplasty at least 3 weeks apart. The first and second thermoplasty sessions will take place together with study visit 2 and 3, and will be treating both lower lobes of the lung sequentially i.e. one at visit 2 and the other at visit 3. The third thermoplasty session will take place together with study visit 4 and will be treating both upper lobes.
      Bronchial biopsies and brushings (optional)
      The research team will take samples (biopsies and brushings) from the breathing passages (bronchus airways) after the participant has had their routine thermoplasty sessions. This will be performed using a thin flexible tube that will already have been used for your thermoplasty procedure and allows instruments to be introduced for taking samples.  The tube is much thinner than the breathing passages and does not limit your ability to breathe. Once in the correct position, the doctor performing the procedure will take the samples that are needed. Cells from the lining of the breathing passages are collected by gently rubbing a soft brush against the side of the breathing passages. Small samples of the walls of the breathing passages are collected using forceps. Biopsies and brushings will only be taken from areas of the lungs that have not undergone thermoplasty during the same session or from areas of the lungs that have been treated 3 or more weeks ago, therefore these will be healed areas of the lungs. The biopsies and brushings will take an additional 5-10 minutes to your thermoplasty procedure.    
      In addition to the risks of the thermoplasty procedure, which will have been discussed with the participant by the treating doctor, by undertaking the additional biopsies and brushings there is a slightly increased risk of bleeding from the nose or on coughing.
      MRI scan (optional)
      An MRI scan uses a powerful magnet and a computer to produce detailed images of any part of the body. In this case we will be looking particularly at the lungs. An MRI scan does not involve X-rays but this technique does involve inhaling two types of gases, Helium and Xenon. The participant will be asked to lie on the scan table and breathe a small quantity of the gas. This is completely harmless. The participant will then be moved slowly into the scanner, which is shaped like a tube. The participant will also be asked to hold your breath for about 20 seconds a few times and the operator will explain this to you. The scan itself will take about 60 minutes and the participant will be monitored throughout the procedure.  
      At one point during the scan a small amount of contrast agent (similar to a dye) will be injected through a small plastic tube (the same as what is used to give a ‘drip’) into a vein in the arm.  This is so that the scans are clear. The small needle to insert the dye into your arm will feel like a sharp scratch. 
      CT scan
      A CT scan is a type of X-ray examination that gives much more information than a normal X-ray. It produces detailed images of the lungs, breathing passages and blood vessels. The scanner itself is shaped like a large donut and is not enclosed.  
      Low radiation dose CT scans will be performed for the purpose of this study. On average in the UK the annual background is 2.5 mSv; however, in Cornwall this is higher at 7.5 mSv per year. For each scan the participant will be exposed to less than 4 mSv; however, the total exposure of scans cannot exceed 10 mSv.  
      The CT scan will expose the participant to radiation. The dose of radiation will be higher than would normally be exposed to, and this may cause a very small increase in the risk of developing cancer. The risk of dying from cancer in the UK is 25%. If the participant were to have 10 mSv extra of radiation, then this risk goes up to 25.05%.
      Sputum Test
      Sputum sample would be obtained from the participant. This will enable the researchers to see how many inflammation-causing cells the airways contain. If the participant is unable to produce a spontaneous sample  they will be asked to breathe in a mist of salty water and cough up any secretions at any time during the procedure. This may cause some chest tightness, wheezing and/or cough. These are all readily reversed by inhaling a bronchodilator (salbutamol inhaler).
      Questionnaires 
      These health questionnaires will ask the participant about their condition, symptoms and how the condition affects their daily life. They should only take around 5 to 10 minutes to complete.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      There is no direct benefit to taking part in the study.  The information we get from this study may help in developing novel asthma treatments in the future. The participant will receive travel and car parking expenses for attending the research and it will be possible to arrange transport for them.  Refreshments will be provided such as tea and coffee.
      The risks associated with the investigations undertaken as part of this study have been described in the about the tests section. 
      Where is the study run from?
      This is a multicentre study with different UK centers participating. 
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?
      The study started in June 2013 and the end date is Jan 2016. Each recruited participant will be involved in the study for approximately 6 months.
      Who is funding the study?
      The study is being funded by the Wellcome Trust and by AirPROM (an EU consortium consisting of academics and pharmaceutical partners).  The study is also supported by the National Institute for Health Research Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit.

TI  - Feasibility of exercises to treat swallowing difficulty after cancer surgery to remove the voice box
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN95066540
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN95066540
AB  - Background and study aims 
      In the UK, 2,400 people each year are diagnosed with cancer of the voice box, which is called the larynx. The total cost of treatment of laryngeal cancer in the UK has been estimated at £96 million over a 5-year period. As part of laryngeal cancer treatment, some patients undergo the removal of the voice box (laryngectomy) and the placement of a permanent hole in the neck for breathing. Common effects of this surgery include needing to leave the table during mealtimes to spit up food stuck in the throat or deal with liquid coming out of the nose. These problems cause embarrassment when eating alone and with others and impact mental health. Despite previous studies indicating that 72% of people with a laryngectomy have problems with swallowing, currently, we do not have enough information to help patients with this problem. As muscle strengthening and stretching exercises have improved swallowing difficulty in those who have a voice box, it is possible that exercises may help people with a laryngectomy enjoy food again without having to undergo further surgery. This proposed research will examine whether patients find the exercises acceptable, suitable and workable to use to improve swallowing after laryngectomy. 
      Who can participate?
      People with laryngectomy aged 18 to 100 years old who have difficulty swallowing and have completed cancer treatment 3 months ago or more
      What does the study involve?
      Some patients who agree to participate in the study will be randomised to exercise every day for 6 weeks and others will be randomised to continue with their usual care. Swallowing ability will be measured at the start of the study and at 3, 6 and 18 months after exercises are completed. Measurements will include questionnaires completed by participants and clinicians. All patients will additionally be asked to volunteer to have a tube placed into their nose to measure pressure during swallowing with a moving x-ray of the swallow recorded simultaneously. We will ask people about how helpful they found the exercises. We will also look at whether the tools used to measure the change in swallowing ability worked well.
      A group of 4 patients has formed an advisory group to help design this study and has agreed to meet 3 times each year over the duration of the study (3 years) to make sure that the information from the study is used in the right way. As a result of the focus group discussion, a laryngectomy patient who has experienced significant swallowing difficulty has agreed to become a patient involvement lead for the study. This patient has influenced the design of the study and has agreed to be available for 4 days each year over the 3-year course of the study to help with tasks related to the study.
      Findings will be written for publication in scientific journals with a plain language summary and presented to patients and members of the public via outpatient clinic leaflets, the National Association of Laryngectomy Clubs newsletter and Twitter. Findings will also be used to plan a future study to see whether exercises really work to improve swallowing after laryngectomy surgery. 
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The findings of this study will have a positive impact on the care of future and current patients by being a critical step in enabling a later study to happen. The findings of this study and the future one will have the potential to improve the quality of life of patients, prevent unnecessary surgery and reduce healthcare costs for patients who have lost their voice box.
      Some participants may find the placement of the tube in their nose to measure pressure a little uncomfortable. If this happens, the tube placed in the nose will be removed.

TI  - Tocilizumab in anti-TNF refractory patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) associated uveitis
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN95363507
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN95363507
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a form of arthritis that develops in children under 16. The cause of the disease is unknown. Symptoms include inflammation, pain and swelling of the joints. There are a number of forms of JIA, including oligoarticular JIA, polyarticular JIA and systemic onset JIA. Eye problems are common and include uveitis, a condition where there is swelling of the middle layer of the eye. Symptoms of uveitis  include painful, red eyes, blurred vision, floaters and loss of peripheral vision. It is not a common condition but is still a leading cause of visual impairment in the UK. Here, we want to conduct a study to test whether adding tocilizumab to methotrexate (MTX) treatment will prevent the serious complications, such as glaucoma, cataracts and detached retina that can occur from uncontrolled uveitis in children with JIA. We wish to test the response rate to tocilizumab in combination with MTX and determine whether further research into this treatment for severe, refractory uveitis should be done.
      Who can participate? 
      Children aged between 2-18 years with JIA and severe uveitis who have not responded or are not getting better on anti -TNF therapy (drugs such as adalimumab and infliximab)
      What does the study involve? 
      All children taking part in this study are given  tocilizumab injections every 2 weeks or 3 weeks as well as MTX treatment.  The dosage for each child is calculated according to their body weight.  Response to the treatment is reviewed after 3 months.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The NHS and its patients would benefit from this trial because patients will be the first worldwide to have access to this novel biological agent within the context of a combined hospital clinic with ophthalmologists and paediatric rheumatologists. Tocilizumab may affect the immune system (your body’s natural defences) and you may be more likely to get infections. Tocilizumab can also increase cholesterol levels, which will be monitored during the course of the study at each visit. Some other common side effects of Tocilizumab are 
      a cough or a sore throat, a blocked or runny nose, a headache or dizziness, mouth ulcers, conjunctivitis, high blood pressure, weight gain or swollen ankles, skin rashes, infections or itching, stomach irritation (gastritis), inflammation around the drip/ injection site.
      Where is the study run from?

TI  - Do patients having major abdominal surgery exhibit significant muscle wasting?
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN96363642
DO  - 10.1186/ISRCTN96363642
AB  - Background and study aims 
      Patients who have major abdominal surgery may require some of their care to be delivered on the intensive care unit (ICU), particularly if they have complications of surgery or have significant pre-existing health problems. Patients on ICU are known to be at risk of developing muscle wasting. This means due to a stress response the proteins in the muscle start to break down. This can cause a decrease in muscle mass and/or weakness. This may hinder their rehabilitation, and their ability to breathe without the aid of a ventilator. It is known that some patients who have cardiac surgery also develop muscle wasting but it is unclear if other types of surgery can have the same effects. The aim of this study is to observe people around the time of (before and after) major abdominal surgery and collect information about changes in mass of a leg muscle.
      Who can participate?
      People over 18 having major abdominal surgery as a treatment for cancer.
      What does the study involve? 
      You receive exactly the same treatment as if you are not participating but routine clinical data is collected, such as information about your surgery and recovery. Additionally the strength of your grip is measured, as is how effective you are at sniffing. We use an ultrasound machine to measure the size of a muscle in your leg. There are additional blood tests. At the end of surgery we place a small device that looks like a wristwatch, on your ankle. The device measures your activity and stays there until you are ready to leave hospital. With the help of your nurse we collect your urine for the first 24 hours following your surgery. During your recovery we visit you on alternate days to see how you are. On day 7 after your surgery or before you leave hospital we ask you to do a 6 minute walking distance test and some other simple exercises to assess your exercise capacity. If you are willing, we want to repeat the tests 6 weeks after your surgery (not the blood test).
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
      Participation in the study will not necessarily benefit you during your hospital stay. The information we get from this study will improve our understanding of muscle wasting and weakness and its effect on recovery from major surgery. This may lead to the development of treatments to improve recovery from major surgery. You will have additional blood test and this will be performed by an experienced practitioner. It is associated with slight pain and some very low risks: sometimes a bruise may develop. Occasionally it can be difficult to find a vein and it may unfortunately take more than one attempt to obtain a sample. As with any wound, an infection may develop where the needle was put in, this is very unlikely.  Some people feel faint during a blood test. You will be encouraged to lie down if this happens to prevent fainting. Nerve injuries are very rare.

TI  - 1 cm vs 2 cm wide surgical excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma

      Background and study aims
      Melanoma accounts for the great majority of skin cancer deaths in the UK. Since the 1990s the diagnosis of melanoma has more than doubled. According to World Health Organisation statistics, the UK has one of the highest death rates from skin cancer in the world. In contrast to most other cancers, melanoma tends to affect much younger people, with nearly half the patients diagnosed at under 65 years old. 
      Melanoma has a tendency for recurring around the original biopsy (tissue sample) site in a very aggressive manner, making it a very challenging problem to treat when it occurs. To prevent local recurrence, the standard treatment has been to take a further safety margin of normal skin and soft tissue around the original melanoma biopsy site. This treatment is offered to every patient diagnosed with melanoma. Surprisingly, this margin of safety has yet to be standardised for melanoma, with a significant variety of excision margins being recommended in different countries (from 1 cm to 3 cm depending on the initial stage of the disease). Since melanoma commonly occurs in the head and neck region or on the limbs, the cosmetic and functional implications for patients with such large defects are substantial. 
      The rate of local recurrence for melanoma is quite low (2-8%) and, despite several large clinical trials, there is little evidence that performing such wide excisions changes recurrence rates or improves survival for our patients. Given that the overall 10-year survival for melanoma is now 90% internationally, with about 150,000 people in the UK currently living with the diagnosis, this has become a key survivorship issue for these patients. 
      The aim of this study is to find out whether a 1 cm excision margin is as safe as a 2 cm margin for high-risk melanoma of the skin. This study is designed to show that the risk of long-term pain associated with surgery can be halved and quality of life can be improved with a 1 cm margin due to reduced side effects and need for reconstructive surgery after treatment. This study will also evaluate the economic impact of safely using less surgery for the NHS and society in general. 
       
      Who can participate?
      Patients aged 18 and over with primary invasive cutaneous melanoma
      What does the study involve?
      Patients are randomly allocated to be treated with a 1 cm or 2 cm wide local excision margin. During the first 2 years after surgery patients should attend follow up at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (+/- 2 weeks) preferably in clinic, but telehealth consultations are permitted. For years 3 to 5 patients attend annual follow up visits.  For years 6 to 10 patients attend annual follow-up visits. These visits are optional and are based on local standard practice or clinician decision. If the patient cannot be contacted, survival data will be collected.
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
      The intervention is a small change to the standard treatment so there are no significant risks from taking part, over and above the risks of surgery which the treating clinician would ordinarily discuss with the patient as part of the standard consent process. Similarly, there are no direct benefits to the patient from participating in this study.
