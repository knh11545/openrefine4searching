AB  - The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using a fluorescent dye, Indocyanine Green (ICG), in endoscopic sinus, skullbase, sinus tumor resection, or posterior epistaxis surgery.\n\nAdults 19 years or older, seen in the Principal Investigator and Sub investigator's offices presenting with either CRS, benign or malignant sinonasal, skull base tumors, or posterior epistaxis will be identified by the Principal Investigators and invited to participate in this prospective study. Patients will be recruited into the study in a consecutive manner. After providing consent, baseline characteristics will be collected. The investigators aim to recruit 10 patients in each study group respectively given the patients diagnosis.\n\nSinus tumor resection - Initially margins will be estimated with the naked eye. Then they will be compared to the margins that are fluorescing with the dye.\n\nSkull base tumor resection - The investigators will use a part of the participant's septum for the reconstruction. The investigators will measure the time it takes for the flap to fluoresce and ensure that it is still lighting up at the end of the surgery. This means that it is still receiving a good supply and ensures longevity of the flap.\n\nSinus Surgery - During the participant's surgery, the investigator will come across important vessels that will be preserved. The investigator will see if the ICG is able to light up those vessels and if it does, then measure the time it takes to light up will be measured.\n\nPosterior epistaxis - If a participant experiences a nose bleed that requires going into the operating room, the investigator will use ICG to locate the vessel that needs to be cauterized. The investigators will measure the time it takes for that vessel to light up.\n\nThe investigator will see the participants back on their day of surgery. During surgery, Indocyanine Green (ICG) will be injected through their intravenous line. The investigator will start with the smallest dose and increase to a dose that allows us to see the structures of interest such as vessels or tumor margins. The time it takes for a vessel or margins of a tumor to light up will be measured. Intra-operative data specific to each type of surgery being performed will be collected.\n\nDose-Escalation Protocol Intravenous injection\n\n* 1.25mg (0.5mL)\n* 2.5mg (1mL)\n* 3.75mg (1.5mL)\n* 5mg (2mL)\n* 6.25mg (2.5mL) \[at discretion of surgeon\]\n* 7.5mg (3mL) \[at discretion of surgeon\]\n\nIntralesional injection\n\n* 1.25mg (0.5mL)\n* 2.5mg (1mL)\n* 3.75mg (1.5mL)\n* 5mg (2mL)\n* 6.25mg (2.5mL) \[at discretion of surgeon\]\n* 7.5mg (3mL) \[at discretion of surgeon\]\n\nDescriptive statistics (count, absolute frequency, and 95% confidence interval) will be used to analyze the baseline characteristic data.

AB  - Because of its rarity, umbilical pilonidal sinus (UPS) is still poorly understood in terms of diagnosis, etiology, and the best treatment options.\n\nUPS is thought caused by hair penetrating the skin, leading to a foreign-body reaction and development of a sinus lined with granulation tissue. Most of the patients complain of pain, discharge or bleeding from the umbilicus when symptoms develop. It can be diagnosed with a careful examination, in which hairs can be seen deep in the umbilicus and usually protrude from a small sinus.\n\nRegarding the optimal treatment of the disease, a complete consensus has not yet been achieved. Some publications are recommended conservative treatment, while surgical treatment is recommended in others.\n\nA more meaningful comparison of the two modalities is that of a randomized controlled trial. We, therefore, present our data of prospective randomized controlled clinical trial comparing conservative versus surgical treatment of UPS.\n\nThis was a multicenter, prospective balanced randomization, double blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, superiority study conducted in Turkey, under the direction of a principal investigator (MK). Eligible patients with UPS were randomized for either conservative treatment (CT) or surgical treatment (ST), and then the results of both groups were compared.

AB  - Pilonidal sinus disease is a health problem that has been attempted to be overcome by various treatment modalities since the first time it was described by Herbert Mayo in 1833. PS is usually diagnosed at 30 years of age, and the disease has a male predominance of 70-80%.\n\nCommon morbidities after the surgical treatment of PS are pain, loss of productive work hours and wound infections owing to long healing times. Therefore, the main goals of treatment are accelerating the healing time by decreasing pain and reducing the loss of productive work hours.\n\nLocal administration of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which contains growth factors (Gfs), is a new method that has been reported to accelerate the healing process by 30-40% \[2\].\n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of PRP on the pain score, wound-healing process and quality of life in the treatment process for PS disease.\n\nMETHOD\n\nTrial Design The investigators designed the trial as a prospective, controlled-randomized study. The study was started after obtaining patient consent and approval from the Ethics Committee of Ankara University Medicine Faculty in Ankara (Ethics Committee no: 03-162-18).\n\nRandomization The patients were divided into three groups randomly. A simple randomization diagram was used for randomization. The open surgical method and a moist dressing were applied to patients in group A. Open surgery and then PRP application were performed on patients in group B. PRP was applied to the patients in group C after curettage of the sinus cavity.\n\nMedical and Demographic History After enrolling the patients, the investigators noted all demographic data, including gender, age, education, comorbid disease existence and drug use. Then, Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) quality-of-life score forms were given to the patients, who were asked to complete the questionnaires before the surgery.\n\nAll patients were asked to clean the sacrococcygeal region from hair using depilatory cream.\n\nSurgical Procedure The investigators designed group A as the control group. In this group, each patient entered the operating room, and after the administration of general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Then, the buttocks were stretched to the lateral sides using adhesive bands to remove the disease area. The sacrococcygeal region was cleaned and disinfected with 10% povidone iodine. After covering the area around the region, the sinus tract was examined by using a thin-steel cane. The length and wealth of the cavity were noted. Then, the sinus tract was removed. The depth of the cavity was noted. Then, 50 cc of 0.9% saline solution (SS) was taken into a syringe and applied to the cavity until it filled the whole space, allowing the cavity volume to be measured accurately. The measurement was performed by subtracting the remaining saline-solution volume in the syringe from the whole syringe volume, which was 50 cc. After measurement of the cavity volume, the cavity was dressed with wet gauze, and the operation ended.\n\nPRP Administration Group B was designed as local PRP administration after excision. Whole steps were applied the same as in the first group until the step of dressing the cavity. After measurement of the cavity volume with 0.9% SS, PRP was administered by filling the whole space from the lateral side of the cavity. After the first implementation of PRP, the second one was applied at 48 hours. Until that time, the dressing was not uncovered. PRP was applied on the 3rd, 4th and 5th days postoperatively.\n\nMinimal Invasive Surgery Group C was designed to receive local PRP administration after minimally invasive surgery with local anaesthesia. In the operating room, after the patient was placed in the prone position, the region was removed by stretching the buttocks with adhesive bands and cleaning the area with 10% povidone iodine. The largest pit was excised, and hairs in the cavity were removed with forceps. Then, the whole cavity was curetted meticulously and irrigated with SS. After haemostasis, the cavity volume was measured, and PRP was applied to the cavity. After the first implementation, as in the second group, we applied PRP on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th days after surgery.\n\nPreparation of PRP For clinical applications, GMP-compliant human platelet concentrates can be created by the PRP method. Erythrocyte concentrate and platelet-containing plasma are separated by the first centrifugation, and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP)/platelet concentrate are created by the second centrifugation of the platelet-containing plasma \[3\]. Platelets contain coagulation factors, growth factors (PDGF, TGFβ1, IGF1, HGF1, VEGF, FGF2) and interleukins (IL1, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL13) \[4\].\n\nThe investigators prepared the platelet concentrate by the PRP method in Hacettepe University Blood Center Laboratory considering all standardized processes for healthy blood donors. In accordance with the 'National Blood and Blood Components Preparation Use and Quality Assurance Guidelines', the requirements for PRP should include at least 40 mL in volume, at least 60x109/unit platelets \[5\], and a maximum of 0.2x109/unit leukocytes \[6\]. After approval, 450 cc of blood was drawn from the patient by phlebotomy on the morning of surgery. A two-stage centrifugation method was used in the process of separating complete blood into its components. In the first stage, plasma was separated with the erythrocyte suspension by using temperature-controlled Heraeus Cryofuge 6000i low-speed centrifugation (22°C, 2500 rpm, 7 minutes). After a 1-hour waiting period at the second stage, the PRP/platelet concentrate was separated from the PPP by using high-speed centrifugation (22°C, 3200 rpm, 15 minutes). The PRP/platelet concentrate obtained after the second centrifugation step was shaken in the agitator for 1 hour, divided into 5 equal parts with a sterile connection device (Figure) and then sent to the Ankara University General Surgery Department.\n\nThe investigators preserved the PRP at 25 degrees Celsius in agitators. Before each dressing, the investigators applied the PRP aliquots to the wound by taking them one by one into the injector.\n\nPostoperative Care All patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. Patients in all groups were advised not to open the wound for 2 days. Additionally, the surgical area had to be kept clean after bathing and bowel movements. If the patients experienced pain, they were recommended to take the prescribed pain reliever no more than 2 times a day.

AB  - Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is usually located at sacrococcygeal region of the body and mostly effect young males causing loss of labor and school time. Its incidence is reported 26 per 100000 in a Norwegian study. Although there are many treatment modalities either surgical or conservative, ideal treatment is still a matter of debate. Surgical techniques such as limberg flap, modified limberg flap and karydakis are most popular treatment methods for pilonidal disease crystallized phenol application is also successfully used for pilonidal sinus treatment by different centers. We would like to compare flap techniques and crystallized phenol application for complications, recurrence, patient comfort, duration of recovery and return to work. We believe crystallized phenol application could become a good alternative to popular surgical interventions using transposition flaps.

AB  - Sacrococcygeal Pilonidal sinus (SPS) is a common disorder with estimated incidence of 1.1% in the community and 9% in soldiers. Pilonidal disease is a function of hair x force x vulnerability of the skin, the theory purposed by Karydakis in his article in 1992, and hair follicle obstruction and enlargement, assertion of Bascom are the most widely accepted explanation for etio-pathogenesis of the disease. It is such a disease that, there is still no clear consensus in regard to its gold-standard treatment modality, even though a lot of research and publications.\n\nHowever, recently off-midline closure techniques has being popularized, by which the suture line is positioned off the midline to ensure minimal chance of recurrence. One of these techniques is the rhomboid, or Limberg, flap (LF) which is widely performed flap surgery for the treatment of SPS in Turkey. However, recurrences can be seen following wide excision and LF reconstruction; therefore, successful implementation of LF technique in the sacrococcygeal area requires well-known characteristics of the flap and problematic anatomy of the gluteal cleft.\n\nThere are many reports that favor Limberg flap over others. Although the authors also used to perform LF in patients with SPS with acceptable results until 2008, then they shifted their routine surgical preference to another off-midline closure technique for cosmetic reasons after this date. But increasingly more cases have administered to our institution due to the complications and recurrences after LF which performed elsewhere. Therefore the authors decided to investigate the technical reasons and risk factors of the problem to avoid complications and recurrence related to the incorrect flap design.\n\nThe authors first hypothesized that there are an association between erroneous off-midline closures and recurrence in patients underwent LF reconstruction for primary SPS. Then they designed a case-control study to test this hypothesis.

Further, there is growing interest in answering the question if different factors, including ENT-surgeries in medical history have an impact on symptoms of rhinosinusitis.\n\nWithin the past few years there is growing interest in carring out as many HPV-vaccinations as possible in order to reduce the prevalence of HPV-associated cancers.\n\nFurther, in adolescents there is a growing number of hearing impairments, including hearing loss and/or sounds in the ears.\n\nNext, since the beginning of the COVID pandemic there are very common complaints in adult and pediatric patients about persistent medical problems for weeks or months after an acute SARS-CoV-2-infection and cannot be explained by another diagnosis, called long- Covid disease.\n\nThe military induction board of conscripts enables access to data from a cross-section of the population, with common characteristics of gender and age.\n\nIn the present study we want therefore to evaluate in conscripts at the military induction board the prevalence of rhinosinusitis, the prevalence of HPV vaccinations, the prevalence of hearing impairments and the prevalence of long-COVID symptoms and further, to evaluate different factors that influence on the one hand the prevalence (urban-bred, non-urban-bred) and on the other hand symptoms (ENT-surgeries in medical history). Further, we want to evaluate if there is a correlation between subjective symptoms and apparated-based diagnostic investigations.

AB  - Intracranial cavernous vascular malformations are variously known as cavernous angiomas, cavernous hemangiomas, or, more simply, cavernomas. Cavernomas are congenital low flow vascular lesions. It composed of irregular sinusoidal vascular channels, lacking smooth muscle, and elastic fibers. They lack feeding arteries or draining veins and contain no neural tissue. The first description of an intracranial cavernoma was given by Virchow, in 1863. For over a century, it was considered to be an extremely rare malformation, usually found at autopsy, and exceptionally diagnosed during life. The prevalence of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) is estimated to be 0.4-0.9%.

DP  - U.S. National Library of Medicine
AB  - In this single-arm non-inferiority study, the study team will aim to evaluate the safety of early feeding in patients with oral cavity reconstruction who are allowed to eat by mouth on post-operative day 1. Traditionally, surgeons have opted to delay the time to oral feeding in oral cavity reconstruction because of concern that an early oral diet may stress intraoral suture lines and lead to the development of salivary leaks. However, evidence from small studies evaluating oral feeding timing in patients who underwent total laryngectomy suggests that there is no increased risk associated with early oral feeding. As such, the study team will aim to determine whether early feeding on postoperative day 1 is non-inferior with respect to the development of orocutaneous fistula to the standard care as described in the literature. There are roughly 50-60 oral cavity reconstructive surgeries performed at Mount Sinai each year - as such it is not feasible to recruit two study arms for direct comparison.\n\nIn addition to salivary leak rates, the study team will report outcomes related to the cohort's wound healing, length of time in the hospital, length of time requiring an enteral tube feeds, swallow evaluation information, and the results of patient reported outcomes measures.

AB  - This study aims to prospectively compare surgical field quality and intraoperative blood loss between patients treated with perioperative intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) followed by general inhalational anesthesia (sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane) to total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) alone, which consists of propofol and remifentanil. A secondary objective would be to perform a cost analysis between these two groups to determine whether one method is financially more advantageous than the other.\n\nThis study will be a prospective double-blinded randomized control trial consisting of patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery to assess intraoperative blood loss, surgical field quality, and cost of the medications administered. The control group will receive total intravenous anesthesia without tranexamic acid during surgery. The study group will receive preoperative tranexamic acid with general inhaled anesthetics during surgery (detailed below). Randomization will be conducted via a pre-determined permuted block system (e.g. AABB, ABAB, BBAA, AABB, etc, where A is TIVA and B is general inhalational anesthetics with preoperative TXA). Subjects who consent to participate will be assigned to the A or B arm depending on whichever arm is listed next in the order.\n\nSubjects will be informed about the study and consented during pre-operative clinic visits. The patient consent and HIPAA authorization forms will be presented at that time where the subject can read about the study followed by any verbal conversation or questions needed between the subject and the study team. This will be done in a private patient room setting. The subject will be notified that participation in the study is completely voluntary and that their medical care will not be affected regardless of their decision to participate. Of note, if patients decline to participate, they will undergo general anesthesia using TIVA without TXA, as this is the standard choice at our institution.

AB  - Infected pilonidal sinuses are a common pathology, affecting an estimated 0.7% of the population. In France, the most commun technique is extended exeresis with an open wound, followed by directed healing. This technique reduces the risk of recurrence, albeit at the cost of daily nursing care and a long healing period involving prolonged absence from work. Closure or plasty surgical techniques aimed at reducing the duration of nursing care are more restrictive, and seem to have higher recurrence rate. Minimally invasive treatment, such as phenolization and flattening with curettage of the sinus have existed for over 50 years, albeit with disappointing long-term results and morbidity that limits their application.\n\nToday, new minimally invasive treatments are being developed, aiming at a less constraining post-operative period. without compromising healing. These include glue, endoscopic treatment (EPSiT : Endoscopic Pilonidal Sinus Treatment or VAASP : Video-Assisted Ablation of Pilonidal Sinus) and laser treatment (SiLaT procedure : Sinus Laser Therapy or PiLaT : Pilonidal disease Laser Treatment).\n\nLaser treatment is used since 2014 in the treatment of anal fistulas and more recently in the treatment of infected pilonidal sinus. A laser fiber is introduced, under local or general anaesthesia, into the main cavity and secondary tracts after curettage and opening of the dimples. The energy delivered by the laser is transmitted in the form of heat, in order to seal the cavity during healing of thermal lesions.\n\nInitial results report success rates of around 90%, with a healing time of between 1 and 2 months. It also appears to be effective after failure of previous surgery. In cases of incomplete closure or recurrence, a second laser treatment can be performed with high healing rates. The investigators carried out an retrospective study including 29 patients treated with the SILAT technique. The healing rate, defined as the absence of symptoms and recurrence of suppuration, was around 70%. The procedure was painless and no serious complications were observed. The presence of one or more secondary orifices and overweight were associated with a higher risk of failure.\n\nIn order to confirm these results, to better specify the factors predictive of success, and to evaluate the efficacy of SiLaT in the longer term, the investigators will carry out a single-center study including all adult patients treated with laser between June 2018 and December 2020.

AB  - Study Description:\n\nThe aim of this randomized comparative study is to investigate the effectiveness of two different approaches to postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing perianal surgery. The study will compare the use of Bupivacaine alone with Bupivacaine combined with Methylene Blue in a pudendal nerve block.\n\nPerianal surgical procedures, such as abscess drainage, fistulectomy, and hemorrhoidectomy, can cause significant postoperative pain. The goal of this study is to find a more effective and prolonged method of pain relief to improve patient comfort and reduce the need for opioids.\n\nParticipants in this study will be individuals scheduled for elective perianal surgery and classified as ASA I and II. They will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:\n\n1. Group A: Participants will receive a pudendal nerve block with Bupivacaine and Methylene Blue.\n2. Group B: Participants will receive a pudendal nerve block with Bupivacaine alone.\n\nThe pudendal nerve block will be performed under ultrasound guidance at the ischial spine level. The needle will be accurately placed between the Sacro tuberous and sacrospinous ligaments for precise injection of the local anesthetic or the local anesthetic combined with Methylene Blue.\n\nThroughout the study, the researchers will closely monitor the participants to assess the time to the first rescue analgesic and pain levels using the Numeric Rating Scale at specific time intervals (2, 6, 24, 48 hours, and 7 days). Additionally, any side effects, allergies, itching, hematoma, infection, or complications like loss of anal sphincter function will be recorded.\n\nPatient satisfaction will also be evaluated using the Likert scale to determine the perceived effectiveness of the different approaches to postoperative analgesia.\n\nBy comparing the outcomes between the two groups, this study aims to determine whether the addition of Methylene Blue to Bupivacaine in a pudendal nerve block can prolong postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing perianal surgery. The findings from this study may contribute valuable insights into improving pain management strategies and enhancing the overall recovery experience for patients undergoing perianal surgical procedures.

AB  - Pilonidal Disease is disease of young patients with significant morbidity and is difficult to treat. Currently multiple methods are practiced for the treatment of the disease, two of them are preferred over others and practice extensively. First one involves excision of pilonidal sinus and dressings while the second one is excision of the pilonidal sinus with application of negative pressure wound therapy. None of these approaches is considered superior to the other, as not enough comparison studies of the two procedures have been done. In order to clarify this and find the best option for our patients, investigators are taking opportunity to compare these two modalities. If participants choose to participate in this study they will be randomly selected to one of these groups and the progress of wound healing will be monitored after surgery with the measurement of wound weekly and photographs. Investigators are hoping to find out which procedure is superior. This will allow investigators to provide the best treatment option for their patients in future.

AB  - Brain shift is the main natural cause of major navigation imprecision. Despite numerous attempts no trials showed a possibility to calculate and predict it's value although some patterns were found. Some modern navigational features allow to partially resolve this problem. Manual shift correction allows to displace brain structures but can only be used if brain shift is linear. Intraoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow to update navigational data but violate surgical workflow and cannot display brain tissue in real time. Intraoperative sonography has poorer quality, limited observe volume and lengthy learning curve.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to calculate magnitude, type of intraoperative brain shift and assess possibility of it's prediction.\n\nFor each patient a surgeon intraoperatively will assess location of brain surface, various intracranial structures and lesion margins during surgery. Postoperatively these data will be compared to lesion's characteristics, patient's state and intraoperative features.

AB  - This is a prospective observational study conducted in the 1st Propaedeutic Department of Surgery of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Patients with imaging and/or histologically proven periampullary tumors in which Whipple operation is indicated will be enrolled in the study after signing a consent designed by the Hospitals Ethics Commitee and the Department of Surgery. Patients information and medical history will be recorded, giving emphasis on clinical presentation, signs and symptoms related to the patients disease. Laboratory tests will afterwards take place, including biochemical parameters such as total bilirubin levels, serum albumin, CA 19-9, CEA, HbA1c and ferritine levels prior to operation. During operation, as soon as the specimen has been removed, the horizontal and vertical dimension of the pancreatic cutting surface will be measured with the use of an one use sterile ruler and the area of the cutting surface will then be calculated as well as the ratio of the two dimensions (horizontal/vertical). The diameter of the pancreatic duct will be measured either with the same ruler in case diameter is equal or greater than 3mm or with a use of a plastic stent in case diameter is less than 3mm. Pancreatic texture will also be assesed. Other intraoperative datas will be recorded such as the anastomosis technique, duration of surgery, amount of fluid administration, transfusion with fresh frosen plasma or blood units.Postoperatively, amylase from the drains, white blood cell count, platelet count and serum crp levels will be recorded on the 1st, 3rd and 5th postoperative day in all patients. The definition used for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is based on the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula 2016 definition and patients will be categorised accordingly. There will be two arms of patients. The first arm will include patients with either no POPF or Biochemical Leak (BL) and the second arm patients with Grade B or C POPF.\n\nAny complication in the early postoperative period ,defined as the first 30 days after Whipple operation, will be recorded and categorised according to Clavien Dindo classification, including reoperation, readmissions or prolongation of hospital stay. After discharge, follow up of the patients include the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PAN 26 questionnaires that patients have to fill in one, three, six and twelve months after surgery. Reccurence and survival rates will accordingly be recorded.

AB  - The study aims to enroll a total of 140 participants. Subjects would be enrolled with the following information: name, age, gender, contact, KPS score, preoperative ASA score, current ECOG score, tumor location, date of surgery, degree of tumor resection (modified Simpson grade), pathology type, Ki-67 Proliferation index, etc. The preoperative magnetic resonance image of the subject is stored. Tissue specimens are genetically examined.\n\nUsing a simple randomization method and random assignment in a 1:1 ratio, a random sequence was first generated, and SAS version 9.1 statistical software was used to generate an allocation sequence table including subject numbers, 140 random numbers, and random groupings. 140 Subjects would be assigned to the test group (n=70) and the control group (n=70) in a 1:1 ratio. The table of the assignment sequence is duplicated and saved by the neurosurgical secretary and the trial designer of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. The secretary puts the group mark into the 140 opaque kraft envelopes with the serial number 1 to 140 according to the order of the allocation sequence table, and submits them to the test designer. Zhige Guo is responsible for enrolling the participants according to the inclusion criteria, assigning the subjects numbers according to the order of the treatment, and Qiang Zeng is responsible for disassembling the corresponding opaque envelopes according to the number of the subjects, and exerting interventions according to the group marks. Chenhan Ling is responsible for follow-up and regular measurement of various indicators, and Fei Dong is responsible for the images reports. Until the end of the trial, Zhige Guo, Chenhan Ling and Fei Dong would not know the grouping of the subjects.\n\nThe test level of the study was α=0.05, and the two-sided test was used. All statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 16.0 statistical software.\n\n1. For PFS, OS, and DSS data, the COX proportional hazards model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of radiotherapy and to assess the statistical difference between the corresponding prognostic data between the two groups.\n2. For the 3-year progression-free survival, 3-year survival rate, and 5-year progression-free survival, 5-year survival rate data, the chi-square test was used to compare the differences between the two groups.

AB  - Anastomotic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy is a feared complication with substantial mortality and morbidity. Treatment of a postoperative pancreatic fistula can be difficult and management may range from a simple observation with or without percutaneous drainage, to the urgent need for reoperation and management of abdominal sepsis with organ failure and prolonged intensive care. To diagnose a pancreatic fistula may have a delay of several days. The risk of death and severe morbidity raises considerable from a biochemical pancreatic fistula compared to the most serious form, a grade C. Also, the cost of managing a patient with a fistula is 1.3-6 times more than a patient with no complications after PD.\n\nMicrodialysis is a promising tool in patients who undergoes pancreaticoduodenectomy for early detection of postoperative pancreatic fistula development. The technique may reveal an fistula before severe symptoms occur and before the complication gives the patient serious and life-threatening symptoms. Earlier intervention of the postoperative pancreatic fistula may lead to better prognosis, less reoperations and interventions and shorter stay at the ICU/hospital. By monitoring intraperitoneal metabolites (glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and glucose) close to the pancreaticojejunostomy, signs of a leakage may be discovered in few hours, thereby make it possible for early intervention and prevent developement of serious progression of morbidity. The investigators want to perform a randomized study where half of the patients will receive a microdialysis catheter implanted close to the pancreaticoduodenal anastomosis before closure of the abdomen. At certain timepoints postoperatively microdialysate will be analyzed for glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and glucose and the data will be used in the decisionmaking of diagnosing a pancreatic anastomosis leakage in addition to standard management. The other half of the patients will not receive a microdialysis catheter and the decisionmaking will only be based on standard management (ie. inflammation markers in blood samples, amylase in drainage fluid).

AB  - 1. Introduction Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a common disease seen in the intergluteal cleft. This disease is usually seen between the ages of 15 years and 35 years, and males are affected more often than females \[1\]. The incidence of the disease is 26/100,000 in the general population \[2\]. The most accepted theory for this disease development is the penetration of shed hair into the skin and is associated with inflammation, abscess and sinus formation \[1\]. The depth of the intergluteal sulcus, the number of loose hair, and the stiffness of the hairs play important role in the disease etiology \[3\]. The reason for the wide acceptance of the acquired theory may be the high recurrence rates of up to 30% even after the most radical local excisions of pilonidal disease, which suggests that a pilonidal sinus is an acquired new disease rather than the persistence of some existing sinuses \[4\]. Although many medical and surgical methods have been proposed for this disease management, no clear consensus about the best method of treatment has been reported so far in the literature. Medical treatment modalities include phenol, silver nitrate, and electro cauterization of the cavity .The surgical options include excising the sinus to the level of the sacrococcygeal fascia and primary closure, or leaving it to secondary healing, Z-plasty, split-skin grafting, Rhomboid flap rotation, or Karydakis flap \[5\]. Eradication of the pilonidal sinus through wide surgical excision is still the cornerstone of treatment, yielding good long-term results, but at the expense of postoperative complications, prolonged hospital stay and a period of off-work up to 4-8 weeks, substantial pain, sub-optimal aesthetic results and recurrence \[6\].\n\n   The main problem after PSD surgery is recurrence, and recurrence rates have been reported in the literature to range from 3% to 46%, depending on the technique used \[7\].\n\n   The aim of the present study was to analyze , evaluate and compare the short term and long term clinical results of this novel technique of combined closed and open approach for management of pilonidal sinus by special U-shaped sutures without drain, Rhomboid flap technique, Karydakis technique and open technique, an approach that allows surgeons to overcome these techniques complications.\n2. Materials and methods This is a controlled clinical trial on 160 patients who had been operated on for PSD between December 2015 and December 2017 in faculty of medicine, Zagazig University, after approval from medical ethical committee. Fifteen patients were lost during the study as we cannot reach them by any way and were excluded from the study. The remaining consecutive patients were included in this prospective analysis.\n\n   The patients were divided into 4 groups: Group A: 40 patients underwent combined open and closed technique, Group B: 40 patients underwent Rhomboid flap technique, Group C: 40 patients underwent Karydakis technique and Group D: 40 patients underwent open technique and wound is left to heal with secondary intention. Patients are grouped randomizally that patient 1 went to group A and patient 2 went to group B and patient 3 went to group c and patient 4 went to group D and the process is repeated.\n\n   Time of operation, postoperative morbidity and hospital stay, and loss of work days, duration of wound healing and recurrence were analyzed. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\n\n   Inclusion criteria include primary PSD in intergluteal region between 18-35 years. Also those fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Chronic discharging sinus/sinuses in natal cleft with or without surrounding tissue inflammation and with associated pain and bleeding on clinical evaluation were also included in our study. Exclusion criteria include recurrent pilonidal sinus, patients who were terminally ill, had Uncontrolled diabetics, were Immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients, had acute pilonidal abscess.\n\n   The patients with PSD underwent the procedure by the same surgeon. Infected sinuses were treated with antibiotics prior to the surgery for at least 2 weeks.\n\n   The patient's age, sex, operation time, mean hospital stay, postoperative wound complications, cosmetic appearance and recurrence rate, and hypoesthesia in the gluteal region were recorded during follow-up period. Clinical assessments were performed postoperatively on the 1st day, 3rd day, 7th day, and 10th day and by telephone on the 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, and 12th month.\n\n   2.1. Operative technique The patients were hospitalized, and the site of the operation was shaved on the day of the surgery. All Patients were operated on under spinal anesthesia. Antibiotic was administered to all patients as prophylaxis 60 minutes prior to the surgery. An adhesive tape was used to part the buttocks. The patients were placed in the jack-knife position. (Fig. 1). Methylene blue was injected without pressure through the external opening to delineate the sinus. The operation site was cleaned with 10% povidone-iodine. All sinus tracts were resected en bloc via elliptical incision down to presacral fascia with meticulous hemostasis. (Fig 2)(Fig.3).\n\n   Group A:The wound was closed with 0 polypropylene sutures including skin, subcutaneous tissue and including the presacral fascia starting 5cm from the edge of the wound and pass to the other side 5cm from the edge of the wound including presacral fascia, subcutaneous tissue and the skin. Then pass 2cm from the edge of the wound and pass through the three layers to the other side in double u-shaped sutures. Multiple sutures are used according to the length of the wound. Sutures were approximated together without tension (Fig. 4-11).\n\n   Group B:Rhomboid flap technique: involve closure of the defect after excision of all sinuses with Rhomboid flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue.\n\n   Group C: Karydakis flap technique: the long axis of the ellipse is parallel to the midline and 2cm from it.undercutting incision is made along the whole length 1cm below the skin surface then unrolling the flap over the midline.\n\n   Group D: Open procedure involved a wide excision of the pilonidal sinus tract and healing by secondary intention.\n\n   2.2. Postoperative follow-up Postoperative management included pressure dressings, low residual diet until the fifth postoperative day, inspection of dressings in every other day, and suture removal on the 21th postoperative day. Instructions on discharge included avoidance of prolonged sitting and riding a bicycle until 8 weeks postoperatively to prevent wound disruption, improving local hygiene and regular removal of hairs by depilatory creams.\n\n   Before discharge from hospital, patients are asked to return to the clinic on postoperative Day 3, Day 7, and Day 10. The skin sutures were removed on the 21th postoperative day. The long-term follow-up (1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, and 12th month) was performed via outpatient interview or by telephone interview.\n\n   Successful treatment was the healing of the wound by subcutaneous scar formation and epithelization of the wound at 8-12 weeks. If skin and subcutaneous tissue reopened with discharge, it is reported as wound dehiscence. The wound that seemed to have healed within the first 8 weeks but recurred later on during the study period (either re-opening of a primarily healed pit or emerging of a new one) was documented as recurrence. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to assess pain.\n3. Statistical analysis:\n\nQualitative data were expressed as absolute frequencies (number) \& relative frequencies (percentage). Categorical data were compared using Chi-square test. All tests were two sided. p-value \< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were collected, tabulated and statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\n. 4. Discussion There is still no consensus about treatment of pilonidal sinus disease. Ideally, therapy should be associated with short hospital stay, less painful postoperative time, rapidly healing and return to work, less painful dressing of wound, short term wound care and a low recurrence rate. No techniques fulfill all of these criteria. We compared our results with other studies to estimate the reliability of our data.\n\nPilonidal sinus is more common in male \[8\]. In our study, male predominate than female (out of the total 160 patients 85% were males and 15% were females). Men are more affected thanks to their natural hirsutism.Most patients were young with the mean age in Group-A being 24.43 (SD ±6.08) and the mean age in Group-B was 27.40 (SD ± 5.90), Group C was 25.4 ± 5.3, Group D was 28.2±4.2. . Comparable results were shown in other similar studies \[17\].\n\nAcute pilonidal abscess should be treated by incision and drainage. In the present study the patients presenting with an acute abscess in the sacrococcygeal region in 12 cases that were initially treated with incision and drainage then postoperatively they were treated by third generation cephalosporin and metronidazole for 10 days. Patients were scheduled for our technique after 15-30 days.\n\nIn a prospective randomized study performed on 50 patients and divided into two equal groups: drained and non-drained. Fluid collections were encountered in two patients (8%) of the drained group compared with eight patients (32%) in the no drained group with the difference being statistically significant \[9\].In our study, absence of wound collection, Seroma and hematoma in Group A and Group D are due to wide drainage by our special sutures technique and the use of third generation cephalosporin antibiotics, choosing non-infected pilonidal disease in most of cases.\n\nA controlled study showed that wound problems, length of hospital stay, morbidity, and recurrence rates did not increase in the absence of postoperative draining of the cavity. Another study also demonstrated that drain placement after rhomboid excision and Limberg flap technique might negatively affect the postoperative complication rate, although the mean operation time was significantly longer in the non-drained group \[10\].In our study, we did not use drain in group A and the results showed decreased hospital stay, no Seroma nor hematoma , very low recurrence rate (2.5%) and infection occurred in one patient(2.5%).\n\nIn group A: most patients stopped analgesic drug on postoperative 3 days. Our patients started to sit on chair without pain on postoperative 10 days .It may result from low tension in the wound.\n\nPrimary closure technique's operation time is short but has significant postoperative morbidity as wound infection rate is 12-32.7%, dehiscence rate is 10- 50% and recurrence rate is 5-12% \[11\]. In this study, Group A showed infection in one patient(2.5%) and the recurrence rate was low (2.5%).\n\nIncision and curettage, unroofing, curettage and excision with marsupialization procedures are common used surgical techniques. But these procedures had painful postoperative time, delayed healing and return to work, painful dressing of wound and long term wound care. But they have a low recurrence rate \[12\]. In this study, postoperative pain was low on pain scale, rapid wound healing, rapid return to work, and painless dressings and in addition, low recurrence rate (1%) When the midline lateralized or flattened, recurrences are less likely to occur \[10\].In our study there is partial flattening of the intergluteal cleft, and so the recurrence rate was low (2.5%).\n\nHospital stay varied from 2 to 5 days \[13\]. Using wide-excision techniques and median time off work was reported from 19 up to 38 days \[14\]. Other studies reported a mean length of hospital stay 2-4 days \[9\]. In the present study the length of hospital stay was 1 day in most cases of Group A and Group C.\n\nThe incidence of wound infection was ranged from 0% to 12% \[15\]. In our study, Group A showed Wound infection in one patient and Seroma did not occur in any patients.\n\nGupta \[16\] reported recurrence rates of 13% using wide-excision techniques, while other studies achieved 5% in larger trials \[17\]. A recurrence rate of 3-10% is described for excision with marsupialization of the wound \[18\]. Reconstructive flaps according to Limberg's technique come with a recurrence rate of 0-6% \[13\] in prospective randomized studies.\n\nIn classic Limberg flap technique recurrence rate is 1.26-5.3% \[19\]. In our study, Follow up time is 12 months and recurrence rate was in one case only (2.5%). Some studies have shown that, in addition to a good surgical technique, elimination of preventable risk factors such as hygiene at the intergluteal sulcus is important to prevent recurrence \[20\] \[21\].Therefore, patients in this study were advised regarding the importance of local hygiene.\n\nPrimary closure of the wound after excision of the pilonidal sinus is associated with a high recurrence rate. In the literature, the recurrence rate after primary closure has ranged from 4% to 25% \[21\].\n\nA common complaint after flap surgery was hypoesthesia on the flap, in our study hypothesia occurred in 59 cases (37%).\n\nConsidering the problems of our study, there are two issues that have to be respected when interpreting our results: First, the recurrence rate of this study might be higher than demonstrated in the result due to shorter of follow up period and missing patients in the follow up period. Second, the wound healing time might have been shorter than it is reported in this study. The wound healing time was assessed by the patients themselves and was not determined by a physician. The wound healing time might more reflect the disappearance of any discomfort at the intergluteal fold than the complete closure of the skin after surgery.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how to lower the patient's risk of the most common complications after their pancreas operation. After tumors are removed and the remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the intestine or closed, a leakage of pancreatic fluid may occur. This fluid may form an "abscess" (collection of pus) or "fistula" that would need to be drained. A fistula is a persistent leakage of pancreatic fluid that sometimes occurs after pancreatic surgery. Fistulas, leaks, and abscesses are complications that are seen in roughly every 15-20 patients out of every 100 that have pancreas surgeries. Complications like these extend the patient's stay in the hospital after surgery. These complications may require the patient's doctor to perform additional tests or procedures to treat them.\n\nThe physical and emotional burden these complications place upon patients, as well as the financial cost to the health care system, can be great. The surgeons at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a study to determine if a drug, SOM230, can help reduce the rate of these complications. SOM230, also known as Pasireotide, is a drug that has been observed to reduce the rate of similar complications in other studies.\n\nThe surgeon would like to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of SOM230 with "placebo" (solution without medication) to see if SOM230 reduces the rate of fistulas, leaks and abscesses.

AB  - Curative management of locally resectable invasive adenocarcinomas located in the cephalic region of the pancreas (pancreas, duodenum and ampulla of Vater) requires a pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major surgery that often leads to major complications including approximately 20% of relevant clinical postoperative pancreatic fistula. Severe postoperative pancreatic fistulas (grade C) require reoperation or lead to organ failure and/or mortality. In an extensive international registry study of pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures, chemotherapy for malignancy was performed in only about 33% (on time in 7% and delayed in 25.6 % of patients) and never delivered in about 67,4 % of patients who experienced a grade C fistula. Therefore, postoperative complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy can lead to early discontinuation of the complete oncologic strategy.\n\nA total pancreatectomy rather than a pancreaticoduodenectomy is an alternative procedure that involves the complete and definitive resection of all pancreatic tissue, eliminating any risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula.\n\nTotal pancreatectomy could represent a major shift in the surgical management of patients with a high-risk of postoperative fistula by eliminating the life-threatening risk associated with fistula and by increasing the opportunity to initiate and to complete adjuvant chemotherapy without delay.\n\nHowever, total pancreatectomy is associated with unavoidable endocrine insufficiency and potentially severe metabolic complications, such as "brittle diabetes".\n\nTotal Pancreatectomy with intraportal Islet AutoTransplantation (TPIAT) is currently performed in patients with chronic pancreatitis under chronic pain failing endoscopic treatment and dependent on long-term opioid treatment.\n\nTherefore, islet autotransplantation following total pancreatectomy can prevent "brittle diabetes" and improve the quality of life.\n\nThe endocrine islets can be isolated from the pancreatic surgical specimen with standardized procedures and transplanted in the liver through intraportal infusion, in absence of immunosuppression and allow adequate control of glucose metabolism with a reduced need for exogenous insulin and an effective graft function in 70% of cases at 3 years\n\nThereby, the investigators hypothesize that total pancreatectomy with intraportal Islet autotransplantation rather than classical pancreaticuduodenectomy, in patients with high-risk of postoperative fistula will increase the rate of complete access to adjuvant chemotherapy, while maintaining an adequate metabolic control.

AB  - Resection of the pancreatic tail is fraught with fistula or leakage of pancreatic enzymes to varying degrees between 13-64%, depending upon which definition one uses. The "downstream" control of the pancreatic duct with the help of a transpapillary stent might minimize the risk for leakage over the transected pancreas surface.\n\nTrial evaluation will be A. The pancreatic bed was drained and postoperatively the fluid was continuously collected and daily analysed for pancreatic amylase and bilirubin. Daily measurement of pancreatic enzyme content in the drain fluid, at least for 5 post operative days or as long as the patient retains the drain. X-Amylase and X-Protein as long as the patient has the external drain.\n\nB. Co-variables measured in the form of: operation time, complications in relation to diagnosis, duration of hospitalization. Patients receiving a pancreas stent are followed in order to evaluate the natural course of the pancreas stent.

AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To monitor outcome to ensure that children and young adults with localized central nervous system (CNS) non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT) treated with induction chemotherapy followed by response evaluation and whole ventricular + spinal canal irradiation (WVSCI) will maintain the excellent 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate as compared to ACNS0122 (NCT00047320).\n\nII. To improve disease control by decreasing the number of spinal relapses for patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and receive WVSCI as compared to whole ventricular radiation on ACNS1123 (NCT01602666).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the response rates to induction chemotherapy and WVSCI for localized NGGCT patients who achieve a CR/PR.\n\nII.

To estimate the PFS and OS for patients with less than a CR/PR following Induction who subsequently receive high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell rescue (HDCSCR).\n\nIV. To estimate the response rate for patients with less than a CR/PR following Induction who subsequently receive HDCSCR.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To prospectively compare outcomes based on radiation modality, photon versus proton, including cognitive, social and behavioral functioning, auditory, and neuro-endocrine function.\n\nII. To compare spinal column growth and cell counts following radiation as measured by height and weight, and complete blood count (CBC) values during and after radiation therapy, based on treatment modality (photon versus \[vs.\] proton therapy) and planned inclusion/exclusion of the vertebral body in patients \< 13 years of age.\n\nIII. To compare local vs. central review recommendations for second-look surgery and document barriers for performing such surgeries as well as their clinical benefit in pediatric NGGCT.\n\nIV.

To evaluate patterns of disease recurrence/failure with respect to radiation dose distribution.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nINDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 90-120 minutes on days 1-3 of cycles 1, 3, and 5. Patients also receive ifosfamide IV over 60 minutes and etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-5 of cycles 2, 4, and 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are assigned to 1 of 2 plans (ventricular + spinal canal irradiation \[WVSCI\] or high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell rescue \[HDCSCR\]) based on response to induction chemotherapy:\n\n* Patients who achieve radiographic CR/PR with marker normalization proceed to WVSCI. Patients who achieve radiographic CR without marker normalization proceed to HDCSCR.\n* Patients who achieve less than radiographic CR/PR with marker normalization proceed to second-look surgery (unless contraindicated). If second-look surgery reveals mature teratoma or non-viable tumor, proceed to WVSCI. If second-look surgery reveals viable tumor, proceed to HDCSCR. Patients who are unable to undergo second-look surgery are removed from protocol therapy but remain on study for follow-up.\n* Patients who achieve less than radiographic CR/PR without marker normalization proceed to second-look surgery (unless contraindicated). Patients then proceed to HDCSCR regardless of whether or not a second-look surgery is performed.\n* Patients who achieve radiographic PR without marker normalization proceed to second-look surgery (unless contraindicated). Patients then proceed to HDCSCR regardless of whether or not a second-look surgery is performed.\n\nPLAN A (WVSCI THERAPY): Within 6 weeks of the end of induction chemotherapy or second-look surgery, patients undergo WVSCI once daily (QD) for 5 days weekly (17 fractions followed by a boost dose for 13 fractions) for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPLAN B (CONSOLIDATION THERAPY \[HDCSCR\]): Within 6-8 weeks of the end of induction chemotherapy or second-look surgery, patients receive etoposide IV and thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3 and undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world by 2030. Patients still have a poor prognosis, and a complete surgical resection provides the only potential for long-term cure of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with a 5-year survival of only around 20%.\n\nIn addition, despite all the advances and technical modifications developed during this past decade, pancreatic surgery is still hampered by considerable postoperative morbidity. Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), with a range of incidence between 3-45%, and the infectious complications (IC) that occur in nearly one-third of the patients are still the more frequent and dreadful complications after pancreatic resection. Moreover, in patients submitted to pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), the constantly growing presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria increases the morbidity and mortality rate. Those complications may also limit access to adjuvant chemotherapy and result in higher costs and longer hospitalization.\n\nThe high clinical burden of pancreatic surgery, associated with the overall poor outcome of PDAC and worldwide diffusion of antibiotic resistance, suggest the urgent need to enhance our knowledge on new and modifiable risk factors able to affect the surgical, the infectious and the oncological outcomes.\n\nThe alteration of the microbiome recently emerged as a contributor to oncogenesis, as a risk factor for postoperative morbidity in many intestinal tract malignancies and as one of the leading causes of colonization by resistant pathogenic bacteria. Recent evidence suggests that the pancreas also harbors its microbiome and in PDAC this is markedly more abundant and with different patterns compared to a normal pancreas in both mice and humans. However, the intestinal and PDAC microbiome have never been compared in humans. Alteration of the microbiome induces an adaptive immune suppression and promotes an inflammatory status. Growing literature evidence shows that the microbiome accounts for local and systemic microenvironment changes. These alterations, characterized by immune suppression and selection of potentially pathogenic bacteria, may lead both to adverse outcomes after surgical treatment and to the overgrowth of multidrug-resistant flora.\n\nNevertheless, the etiologic relationship between intrapancreatic microbiota and postoperative complications in PDAC patients subjected to surgery has not yet been described.

AB  - This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial included all patients who developed the manifestations of low output recurrent colonic fistula or leak after colonic anterior resection for rectal cancer at Zagazig University hospital between (December 2020 to August 2022). The study was prospectively approved by Zagazig University Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board (Approval Number: 10027/26-10-2022).The investigators performed the study under the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for studies involving human subjects. They got written informed consent from all participants after explaining to them all the study procedures with its benefits and hazards. Patients with recurrent low output colo-cutaneous fistula (less than 500cc/24h) or leak after anterior resection due to rectal cancer , patients who subjected to conservative measures but failed , patient with good general condition (ASA I\&II), patients with size of fistula less than 15mm and patients with good nutritional status were included and eligible for randomization. The investigators excluded patients who were with bad general condition (ASAIII\&IV\&V), patients with high output fistula , patients with recto-vaginal or recto-vesical fistula, patients with size of fistula more than 15mm and patients were treated with conservative measures.\n\nIncluded eligible patients were simply randomized at a 1:1 ratio to "Endoscopic (SG)" or "Surgical Group (EG)" via the drawing of sealed envelopes containing computer-generated random numbers prepared by a third party before the start of the intervention.\n\nThe sample size was calculated by using an open Epi program depending on the following data; confidence interval 95%, power of the test 80%, ratio of unexposed/ exposed 1, the success rate of endoscopic management of low output colonic fistula after anterior resection of rectal cancer versus surgical management was 60.2% versus 90% respectively . Odd ratio 0.17, and risk ratio 0.67, so the calculated sample size equal 78 patients divided into two equal groups.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcomes were success rate in managing the fistula , postoperative hospital stay, and complications and mortality in each group after the intervention during the 3-months follow-up period, respectively.\n\nDiagnosis After full history taking and complete physical examination, low output colonic fistula or leak after anterior resection for rectal cancer was clinically suspected and then confirmed by laboratory investigations (complete blood picture, liver and kidney functions, coagulation profile), radiological imaging (abdominal US to exclude any abdominal collection, CT abdomen with oral and I. V contrast, MRI in some situations and virtual colonoscopy to exclude any distal obstruction , distal narrowing or recurrence of the cancer ).\n\nIntervention:\n\nPatients involved in endoscopic group were firstly subjected for Interventional Radiology to drain any intra-peritoneal collection present in preoperative radiology then were subjected either to Clips application (OTSC, OVASCO Endoscopy AG. Tubingen, Germany) or Endo-suturing (Overstitch, Apollo Endo-Surgery , TX, United states) to close the low output fistula or leak after anterior resection for rectal cancer. The endoscopy was done under sedation, not general anesthesia after colonic preparation (chemical \& mechanical preparation) firstly, to detect size of fistula . Clips were used in cases with fistula's size less than 10 mm, while Endo-suturing devices were used in cases with fistula's size more than 10mm till 15mm.\n\nPatients involved in surgical group were subjected to either redo of resection anastomosis manually or by circular stapler or primary repair of the defect with ileostomy. This was done under general anesthesia after colonic preparation.\n\nFollow up after endoscopy and discharge from the hospital:\n\nAll patients were subjected for clinical examination \& laboratory investigation during the hospital stay. Any suspected colonic leak or fistula post intervention mandated CT scan with oral and I.V contrast and lower GI endoscopy. Patients were followed-up for at least 3 months post repair.\n\nStatistical analysis Analysis of data was done by IBM computer using SPSS (statistical program for social science version 23): description of quantitative variables as Mean, SD, median and IQR, Shapiro test of normality used to check the data distribution, description of qualitative variables as number and percentage, Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables between groups, Fisher exact test was used when one expected cell or more are less than 5, Mann-Whitney test was used instead of unpaired t-test in non-parametric data (SD\>30% mean). I considered the results statistically important when the important probability was less than 0.05 (P \< 0.05). P-value \< 0.001 was considered highly statistically important (HS), and P-value ≥ 0.05 was considered statistically insignificant (NS) (10).

The therapy-oriented severity grading system (TOSGS) of complications will be used and complications will be allocated to surgical (SSC) and non-surgical site (NSSC) complications\n* The adequacy of the surgical resection margins (pR0) and the magnitude of the tumour-free resection margin (millimetres) will be monitored\n* Postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) will be registered\n\nPatient randomization and registration procedure (randomization lists attached)\n\n* This is a multicentric randomized controlled trial.\n* Patient randomization will be done intra-operatively since a substantial number of patients could be dropped out intra-operatively because of the presence of unexpected intra-abdominal metastases at the time of surgery.\n* Patient stratification will be performed for each centre and will be based on the diameter of the pancreatic duct. A pancreatic duct at the level of the surgical transsection margin measuring 3 millimetres or less in diameter is defined as being a "soft pancreas". A pancreatic duct measuring more than 3 millimetres is defined as a "hard pancreas".\n* A prospective registration of following parameters will be performed: intra-operative diameter of the pancreatic duct at the surgical transection margin, diameter of the pancreas at the surgical transection margin, pancreatic tissue consistency assessed by the surgeon: soft vs. hard, post-operative pathology parameters.\n\nStatistical analysis and sample size calculation based on a stratified design\n\n* 40% of patients are expected to have a hard pancreas and 60% a soft pancreas.\n* It is assumed that the magnitude of the effect of the intervention (PJ vs. PG) on the POPF rate, expressed as an odds ratio (OR), is similar in both strata.\n* The needed sample size is calculated to have 80% power to detect a common odds ratio of 2.7. POPF rates of 12% and 20% are assumed after PJ within the hard and soft pancreas stratum respectively (yielding 4.8% and 8.4% after PG). Note that, given the unequal size strata, this leads to an expected POPF rate of 16.8% after PJ and 7% after PG (≈12% POPF overall).\n* A 2-sided (with alpha=5%) Mantel-Haenszel test of OR=1 for stratified 2x2 tables is planned\n* 168 patients are required per group (total patient population 336)\n* Expected duration of recruitment: 3-4 years\n* An interim analysis will be performed annually (i.e. after inclusion of 1/3 and 2/3 of the patients) to to allow early stop of the study (or accrual of patients in a specific treatment group) due to rejection of the null hypothesis.

AB  - Focused study on laser hair depilation in patients with darker skin types is critical to promote equitable health care across all patients with pilonidal disease. We propose a pilot RCT of laser hair depilation to the gluteal cleft in darker skin adolescents and young adults with pilonidal disease to estimate the efficacy of laser hair depilation to decrease disease recurrence compared with standard of care. This study will enroll patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI to be inclusive of both Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black populations to allow us to investigate efficacy of this treatment across ethnic and racial groups and skin type.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of laser hair depilation to prevent recurrence of pilonidal disease at 1 year among patients with Fitzpatrick skin types of IV-VI. We hypothesize that laser hair depilation will lower disease recurrence at 1 year follow-up compared to mechanical/depilation alone (current standard of care).\n\n* We will perform an RCT comparing laser hair depilation with mechanical/chemical depilation (intervention group) to mechanical/chemical depilation alone (control group).\n* Primary outcome: Disease recurrence at 1 year defined as development of an abscess, folliculitis, or draining sinus which requires treatment (antibiotic therapy, surgical incision and drainage, or excision).\n\nSpecific Aim 2: To investigate the efficacy of laser hair depilation to reduce pilonidal-related morbidity, improve healthcare satisfaction, and increase health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI. We hypothesize that laser hair depilation will reduce disability, improve healthcare satisfaction, increase HRQOL, and lead to fewer procedures.\n\n* Disability days, defined as the number of reported days in which the patient was not able to participate in all activities or work, will be calculated at 1 year and compared between the two groups.\n* Patient satisfaction with care and HRQOL will be measured with validated PedsQLTM instruments.\n* Procedures, admissions, emergency department visits, and complications will be compared.\n\nThis pilot study will generate the efficacy estimates needed to design a multicenter RCT to provide definitive evidence to support equitable inclusion of laser hair depilation as a treatment adjunct for pilonidal disease.

AB  - Background: Pilonidal sinus is a very common disease. Malignant transformation occurs in 0,1% of patients. The investigators present a case of squamous cell carcinoma arised from recurrent pilonidal disease, managed by multimodal treatment.\n\nCase presentation: The investigators present a 70-year-old man with chronic pilonidal sinus. Inflammation had worsened in previous months and exploration revealed a large ulcerative mass which biopsy showed a squamous cell carcinoma. CT scan and MRI imaging showed tumoral invasion of the coccyx and both gluteus major muscles. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy as radiosensitizer and surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy was decided in the multidisciplinary tumor committee. Post neoadjuvant therapy MRI showed partial response with a decrease of the mass but persistence of the coccyx infiltration.\n\nSurgery consisted in en-bloc resection of the tumor with presacral tissues, coccyx and partial gluteal resection. Intraoperative radiotherapy was administered over the sacrum and in the bed of the coccyx resection. One week later, reconstructive surgery was practiced using a latissimus dorsi free flap, advancement of gluteal flaps and skin graft. Histological examination showed no residual tumor. The patient is currently asymptomatic and he has a satisfactory quality of life.\n\nConclusions: Although squamous cell carcinoma is rare, it must be suspected in patients with recurrent pilonidal disease. Diagnosis is done by histological examination of biopsies. This type of tumors have a high local recurrence rate. The investigators propose a multimodal treatment that includes neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy as radiosensitizer and surgery plus intraoperative radiotherapy with the aim to decrease local recurrence rate.

AB  - Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) has been defined as a disease characterized by chronic inflammation and recurrent infections caused by the movement of hair toward the gluteal sulcus. This condition is especially seen in young men and negatively affects the quality of life of patients and prevents them from performing their work and school activities. The treatment options for PSD range from the use of antibiotics alone to reconstructed excision with tissue flaps. Although the optimal surgical treatment option remains controversial, expectations from the ideal surgical treatment include low recurrence and postoperative complication rates, early wound healing, short hospital stay, early return to work, and good cosmetic outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of the different flap techniques in the surgical treatment of PSD and evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients.

The first technique will involve pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus before the dura is opened and the tumour attacked, and the second group of cases will be operated by a standard technique, where the tumour will be directly attacked with out pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Blood loss will be monitored in each case by calculating the amount of blood in the suction container and subtracting it from the amount of fluids used for irrigation during surgery. The number of cotton patties and dressings will be also counted with each case as well as the number of gauzes used. The pre-operative complete blood picture will be documented particularly the haemoglobin , hematocrits and others. The same lab data will be also monitored after surgery. The amount of blood transfusion required will also be calculated in each case.

AB  - In this study the ERAS program is applied to patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.This is a prospective observational cohort study.The study will take place in two hospitals, the University General Hospital of Larissa (academic center), and IASO Thessalias (largest private general hospital in Thessaly). The study period is three years between May 2022 and April 2025. All patients undergoing pancreatic surgery during this period will be invited to participate in the study. Recruitment will take place at the first appointment with the surgeon when the patient is listed for surgery. The patient will be provided with detailed information about the program which also includes an information leaflet. A written consent form will be signed by patients willing to participate in the study.\n\nEnrolled patients will follow the ERAS pathway for pancreatic surgery during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative period. The ERAS protocol is based on ERAS society recommendations for enhanced recovery after pancreatoduodenectomy.\n\nThe ERAS protocol consists of the following items:\n\nFirst appointment preoperative:\n\n* Patient education about the program\n* Prehabilitation with advice on physical exercise and nutritional support\n* Advice to stop smoking and alcohol consumption\n* Plan for optimisation of comorbidities\n* Completion of quality of life questionnaire\n\nDay before surgery:\n\n* Discussion about the program to address any patient concerns and anxieties\n* Light meal and carbohydrate drink before bedtime\n* Anti-clotting injection 12 hours before surgery\n\nDay of surgery:\n\n* Carbohydrate drink and painkillers 3 hours before surgery\n* Clear fluids allowed up to 3 hours before surgery\n* Antibiotics within 1 hour before surgical incision\n\nIntraoperative\n\n* Epidural catheter is sited before general anaesthesia\n* Multimodal and opioid-sparing analgesia\n* Nausea and vomiting prophylaxis\n* Goal directed fluid therapy\n* Active warming to avoid hypothermia\n* Monitoring of blood glucose to maintain normoglycaemia\n* Bile culture\n* Repeat antibiotics if surgery lasts more than 4 hours\n\nPostoperative:\n\n* Removal of nasogastric tube by postoperative day 1\n* Removal of drains by postoperative day 3\n* Multimodal analgesia, epidural catheter for 3 days, minimisation of opioids\n* Early and scheduled mobilisation and respiratory physiotherapy protocol\n* Diet protocol with nutritional drinks and gradual progression from light to solid diet by postoperative day 5\n* Removal of urinary catheter when patients able to mobilise on their own, by postoperative day 5\n* Cessation of intravenous fluids when patients able to drink 1.5 liters of water, by postoperative day 5\n* Regular gastrokinetic medication and gum chewing\n* Glycaemic control protocol\n* Cessation of antibiotics if bile culture negative and no other indication to continue\n\nThe study group will use a checklist with ERAS criteria to follow for each patient and data will be collected on adherence rates to these criteria.\n\nData will be collected on patient demographics such as sex, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, and co-morbidities. Data will also be collected on surgical approach and technique, and tumour stage (pTNM). Data will be collected on complications including cardiovascular and respiratory complications, infectious complications (surgical site infection, chest infection, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis), anaesthetic complications (severe pain, delirium, cognitive decline), functional complications (functional decline, new mobility aid use, pressure ulcer, discharge to nursing or rehabilitation facility), renal failure, ileus, return to theatre, readmission, and death. Data will be collected on length of stay and pancreatic surgery-specific complications such as DGE, PPH and POPF formation. International consensus guidelines will be used for definition and grading of these complications.\n\nQuality of life will be assessed by Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS). The stress response will be assessed by measuring NLR and PLR. After anonymization, all data will be prospectively uploaded by local investigators on a protected database and incorporated into a spreadsheet for data analysis.\n\nThe data will be analyzed using PROMs, NLR and PLR ratios, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and cancer recurrence rates as the main outcome variables.The influence of the following factors will be assessed: age, BMI, sex, surgical technique, pTNM stage, preoperative comorbidity, ASA classification, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and compliance to the ERAS protocol (\<50%, 50-70%, 70-90%, \>90%). Adherence will be calculated as the number of interventions fulfilled/20 (total number of preoperative and perioperative interventions).\n\nThe statistical model will be multivariate regression analysis. Sample size guidelines for observational studies with regression analysis are based on simulation studies and suggest that the minimum number of events per variable (EPV) should be 10. According to these guidelines the minimum sample size is calculated at 90. To account for 25% loss to follow-up the investigators aim for a total enrollment goal of 120 participants. IBM® SPSS 26 software will be used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables will be compared with One-Way ANOVA or Student's t test for parametric data and with a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test), as indicated. Categorical data will be analysed by using the chi squared or Fisher's exact test where indicated. Quantitative values will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), median and range, categorical data with percentage frequencies. The odds ratio (OR) will be presented followed by 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Differences in survival and complications between different degrees of compliance will be assessed by the application of log rank test. P \< 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

AB  - Despite the availability of microsurgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernoma treatment and known genetic causes of most familial forms of cavernoma, uncertainties remain about cause, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and care. According to the recently published CM treatment guideline, surgical and conservative treatments are both first-line therapeutic options in previously untreated CMs (U-CMs). However, given current data, neurosurgeons are still unable to counsel patients on which would be the best option. To address the absence of high level evidence to support cerebral CM treatment decisions, there is a need for a large sample size study of cerebral CM treatment with a prospective concurrent group. China has the largest population in the world and may have the most extensive and valuable clinical resources of U-CMs. But, till now, the current treatment and outcome situation of the disease in China is not well known. Thus, the investigators are conducting a nationwide multicenter prospective registry study in China to determine the effect of different treatments on long-term outcomes in patients with untreated cerebral cavernous malformations.At least 2000 patients with untreated cerebral cavernous malformation will be enrolled from 20 Grade Ⅲ A level hospitals distributed all over China. Clinical data and laboratory data are prospectively collected by electric case report form (CRF) and uploaded online by each neurosurgery center to form the prospective clinical database in First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. This is a cohort follow-up study across a 5-year period with a 2 years interval of enrollment and 3 years follow up for each patient.

AB  - The standard Draf III procedure was performed as described by Gross and Wormald using an "outside-in" technique. The cranial portion of the nasal septum was removed, and the frontal process of the maxilla and frontal beak were carefully abraded, resulting in the "frontal T". Distinct to the procedure of Gross and Wormald, the frontal T was then lowered to the first branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery instead of the first olfactory fibre.\n\nTumors were totally resected under endoscope and lateral pedicled nasoseptal flaps were applied for covering the exposed bone around frontal neo-ostium. The pedicled nasoseptal flaps were applied in the experimental group and no flap was applied in the control group.\n\nThe pedicle of the flap was designed to be on the frontal process of the lateral nasal wall. The lateral anterior incision was approximately 1 cm anterior to the maxillary line, with the medial anterior limit in parallel on the septum. The lateral posterior limit was the maxillary line and medial posterior limit parallel to the anterior limit where the first branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery arises on ethmoidal roof. The lower limit of the septal part was at the level of the lower border of the middle turbinate. The flap was carefully elevated from the cartilage and bone, particularly the supra-axillary and olfactory fossa part. The flap was then persevered posteriorly in the nasal floor or maxillary sinus for subsequent use. The contralateral flap was harvested and preserved in a similar manner. Type 1 flaps consisted of mucosa over the lateral nasal wall, and type 2 flaps consisted of the aforementioned mucosa and corresponding septal mucosa.\n\nAll patients were followed up for at least 12 months, and the nasal cavity was assessed and cleaned regularly under endoscopy. The neo-ostium section area was compared to that at the end of surgery. Epithelization was identified if the neo-ostium were smooth without edema, discharging or crusting after surgery under endoscope. The time required for epithelialization of each patient was also recorded. Restenosis was defined as \>50% reduction in the section area at 12 months postoperatively.

AB  - METHODOLOGY:\n\nThis randomized control trial includes all patients undergoing whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy st Asian Institute of Gastroenterology. All patients were randomized by a closed envelope technique. The envelope was opened after complete resection of the specimen and then allocating the patients into either of the two groups, Group A- Infracolic Gastrojejunostomy, Group B- Supracolic Gastrojejunostomy.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients undergoing whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy, who consented for the trial and found to be resectable at surgery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unresectable tumors at surgery\n* Patients in whom gastric emptying studies could not be done due to any reason\n* Documented Mechanical obstruction at Gastrojejunal anastamosis\n* Post operative mortality due to other causes\n\nAfter the resection, a Roux loop of jejunum is prepared and taken up through a rent in the transverse mesocolon to which an end to side Hepaticojejunostomy followed by Pancreaticojejunostomy is done in both the groups.\n\nIn Group A Infracolic gastrojejunostomy is done in the infracolic compartment to the same loop of jejunum after pulling the stomach down through another rent in the transverse mesocolon to the left of middle colic artery, thereby compartmentalizing or separating gastrojejunostomy from Hepaticojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy.\n\nIn Group B Supracolic gastrojejunostomy is done in the supracolic compartment to the same Roux loop of jejunum.\n\nAll the patients undergo a feeding jejunostomy. Postoperatively all the patients were managed according to a standard protocol, daily monitoring of Ryle's tube output and drain fluid output was recorded. Drain fluid amylase levels and serum amylase levels were estimated on postoperative day 3, 5 and 7. Ryle's tube was removed if the output was \<200ml in 24hrs after confirming that the tube was patent.\n\nOral feeds were started after removal of Ryle's tube, initially with liquids followed by semisolids and then normal diet. Patient's daily intake is recorded. Any adverse event of vomiting, abdominal distension and succussion splash was recorded by the person blinded about the technique of anastamosis. If there was clinical suspicion of gastric outlet obstruction, Ryle's tube was placed and output recorded. If mechanical cause for gastric outlet obstruction was suspected, then contrast study and/or gastroscopy was done to confirm.\n\nGraded enteral nutrition was started in all the patients from post operative day 3 through the feeding jejunostomy tube.\n\nAny medications effecting GI motility were avoided till the gastric emptying studies were performed\n\nClinically delayed gastric emptying was defined according to International study group of pancreatic Surgeons (ISGPS), as Grade A, B and C. Pancreatic fistula was defined based on International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) as Grade A, B and C.\n\nRadio isotope gastric emptying studies were done for both liquids and solids on postoperative day 7 \& 8 respectively. Test was performed and interpreted by the investigator who is blinded about the type of anastamosis.\n\nAt the end the groups will be analyzed whether they were comparable with regard to the age, sex and diagnosis. The gastric emptying (Clinical, liquid meal and solid meal emptying) will be compared between both procedure groups. Correlation of clinical evidence of gastric emptying with liquid and solid emptying is calculated. Correlation of pancreatic anastomotic leak with gastric emptying is also done.\n\nPROTOCOL OF GASTRIC EMRTYING STUDY:\n\nLiquid study on one day \& solid study on the next day\n\nTracer to be use:\n\n1.

AB  - Despite improvements and advances in pancreas surgery, about 30-35% of patients who have pancreas surgery develop a type of complication called a pancreatic fistula. A pancreatic fistula occurs when fluid produced by the pancreas leaks into the abdomen after pancreas surgery. Patients who develop a pancreatic fistula can have poor short-term and long-term consequences.We are studying the effect of a medical device named HEMOPATCH on the development and seriousness of pancreatic fistulas. HEMOPATCH is a thin, flexible bovine protein-based pad that may improve tissue sealing where it is applied during surgery. Some small studies called case studies of between 2 and 7 patients, and two clinical trials have shown that HEMOPATCH is effective at stopping bleeding and reducing drain output after some types of surgery. However, there have been no completed clinical trials using HEMOPATCH to prevent or reduce pancreatic fistulas in patients having pancreas surgery, so we don't know if it works in this setting. Health Canada has approved the use of HEMOPATCH as a device to stop bleeding or seal other bodily fluids for procedures in which the control of bleeding or leakage of other body fluids or air by standard surgical techniques are either ineffective or impractical.

AB  - In the study, the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program is applied to total pancreatectomy (TP) and low-risk pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) patients identified by a small number of acinar cells in the cut edge of the pancreas. The research setting is randomized and controlled. All patients arriving at the Tampere University Hospital (TAUH) for PD or TP surgery are recruited into the study. Patients will be sent a handout of the study along with the letter of invitation for the surgery itself. Recruitment takes place at the first appointment of the surgery where the surgeon presents the study to the patient. If the patient wishes to participate in the study, the patient issues a signature on the consent form. They are randomized to this ERAS program for shortened recovery period and a standard protocol recovery program. Allocation to the groups takes place using opaque envelope-coded randomization codes. The research nurse prepares the envelopes in twelve patient randomization blocs.\n\nTo determine the low risk PD-patients recruited, the pathologial sample of the cut-edge of the pancreas is analyzed by pathologist during the surgery. If the pancreatic cut-edge contains less than 40% acinar cells, the patients is considered low risk patient. This method is based on earlier studies in our pancreatic research group. All TP patients are per se in the small complication risk group. Only those patients with a low risk of complications continue to be involved in the study in standardized or ERAS protocol groups according to the original allocation.\n\nERAS protocol consist of following actions in comparison to standard protocol:\n\nFirst appointment:\n\n- Enlightenment on the benefits and objectives of the ERAS protocol\n\nCall to the patient day before the surgery:\n\n* Discussing the course, benefits and goals of care in ERAS\n* 4 dl PreOp drink before bedtime\n\nOperation day:\n\n* Fluid intake allowed 2 hours before surgery\n* 2 dl PreOP drink 2 h before cutting\n\nIntraoperative:\n\n* Drains in the peripancreatic or perihepatic regions are not set unless the surgeon sees this particular reason\n* The nasogastric tube is removed at the end of the surgery\n\nPostoperative:\n\n* Mobilization with nurses assisted, possibly sitting on the edge of the bed if possible\n* Drinks allowed after 4h surgery\n\nPostoperative day 1:\n\n* Drinking and normal food by mouth according to the patient's capabilities\n* Removal of urinary catheter\n* Intravenous liquids only if needed\n* Mobilization physiotherapist and nurse guided as actively as possible\n* Pain management by epidural cannula at the level to make mobilization possible\n* Discussion of the ERAS protocol (objectives, benefits, time of passing to follow up care) (also continues on the following days) and encouragement\n* If drains are set: amylase tests\n* Pancreatin capsules per os before eating, 25,000 IU 1-2 capsules on big meals and 1 on snack (continued on the following days)\n\nPostoperative day 2:\n\n- Mobilization: As much as possible, autonomous movement\n\nPostoperative day 3:\n\n* Ending epidural infusion, cannula removal later if p.o. medication is sufficient\n* As independent as possible\n\nPain relief: oxycodone / naloxone p.o. to keep mobilization possible:\n\n1. 2x 5 / 2.5 mg ≤ 60 kg\n2. 2x 10/5 mg\> 60 kg\n3. 2x 15 / 7.5\> 100kg. In addition, paracetamol 1g three times a day p.o.\n\nPostoperative day 4:\n\n* Support and encouragement continues\n* Pain management at a level that allows mobility\n* Passing to follow up care when following criteria are met:\n\n  1. The patient should be able to enjoy at least two meals without significant nausea\n  2. Bowel movements returned\n  3. The patient should be able to move, urinate, and perform daily operations at pre-operative level\n  4. The patient does not need strong analgesics when moving\n  5. The temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate should be in the reference range or pre-cut level.\n  6. The patient has no signs of bleeding.\n* Pain medication changes to tramadol 100 mg three times a day when discharged\n\nFor all those involved in the study, PD's surgery technique is standardized to classic Whipple surgery, submersion bowel-pancreatic seam, antecholic gastro-jejunostomy and entero-entero anastomosis.\n\nThe patient is left out of the study if a patient is undergoing another surgery than PD, TP or does not undergo surgery at all. Likewise, the study is suspended from the consideration of the surgeon if, for any other reason, the patient may be expected to be a high complication risk patient.\n\nTypical complications (pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage) are registered during hospitalization and their severity ratings according to ISGPS, ISPGF and Clavien-Dindo classifications are also determined. Other variables registered are the number of intensive care days, situations requiring new surgeries, 30 and 90 day mortality, the completion time of the criteria for passing to follow up care, and the total length of hospitalization. In addition, the need for readmissions is registered. The implementation of the ERAS protocol is followed by a separate tracking template, in which the nurses record the progress of the goals specified in the protocol on a daily basis. The results of the study are analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nThe main variable of the study is the treatment period at the university hospital. The side variables are the total treatment time, the total amount of complications, and the number of readmissions. The hypothesis is that recovery is faster in the ERAS group, but the occurrence of complications and readmissions are the same in both groups.\n\nA statistical power calculation, assuming 80% statistical power (1-β) and 5% significance level (α), was carried out with a continuous outcome superiority trial. The sample size was calculated using the main coefficient of variation assuming that in the standard protocolled patients the median of the discharge time is nine days and in the ERAS program for seven days, i.e. a presumption of approximately 20% decrease in treatment days. Three days were assumed to be the standard deviation. The sample size thus obtained is 36 per group, which is rounded up to approximately 80 patients in total.\n\nWhen evaluating the time spent collecting the data, it is assumed that 20% of the patients will drop out of the study for various reasons. In TAUH, approximately 100 PDs and 15 TP patients are operated in two years and approximately 70% of patients of PD are in a low risk of complications. Consequently, the number of patients to be collected in two years would be approximately 0.7 ∙ 0.8 ∙ 100 + 0.8 ∙ 15 ≈ 68, which is almost sufficient for the purpose of this study to achieve statistical significance. The estimated duration of the study is therefore little more than two years. However, the study will be continued as long as necessary to collect the required number of patients. When half of the final number of patients has been collected, an interim analysis is made of the differences in the groups. If the results of the ERAS protocol are at least as good as the standard group, the study will be continued.\n\nAll recruited patients are asked for written consent for participation in the study. The research file is stored in the TAUH research register. Patient information and research results are treated confidentially in the manner required by the Finnish Personal Data Act. The final research results are reported at group level and the identification of individual investigators is not possible. The research funding is provided by the Tampereen Pancreatic Research Group the largest funders being the State Research Fund and Sigrid Jusélius Foundation. Also Finnish Medicine Foundation in providing personal funding.\n\nThe research has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tampere University Hospital. The earlier ERAS studies have shown that their use is safe and in most cases beneficial to the patient. In this study, it is novel that only small complication risk patients are included in the study. In addition, halfway between the research is performed an interim analysis to ensure the safety of the ERAS protocol. Patient's own consent is asked before surgery, and information on the research is provided within the limits of the success of the study. Patient's refusal or suspension of study does not affect the patient's treatment in any way.

AB  - Pilonidal cyst was first described by Hodges in 1880. The disease of pilonidal cyst is also known as "Jeep disease", due to the fact that, during World War II (1941-1945), several American soldiers (about 80,000) suffered from this disease, because, either they were driving for long hours on uneven, destroyed by war, roads, or, they were spending time sitting at military vehicles like jeep, trucks and tankers, resulting in being submitted to surgical operation, in order to alleviate the arousing pilonidal cyst problem, at USA military hospitals.\n\nPilonidal cyst, is considered as one of the most common diseases of the subcutaneous tissues of the sacrococcygeal region. This situation is the result of hair penetrating into the skin, a situation not uncommon in this anatomical area. In a study including 50,000 college students, pilonidal cyst occurrence, in males, was 1.1%, which was 10 times higher compared to females, although a considerable rate of them was asymptomatic. Evidence from studies in England, also, indicate that the disease is more frequent in men than women (1 to 3) . The disease is more common in Caucasians than in Asians or Africans due to the differences in their hair characteristics and the respective hair development pattern. Risk factors include the following: sedentary life (44%), positive family history (38%), obesity (50%) and regional irritation (34%). The disease usually presents during the age of 16 - 20 and prevalence is decreasing drastically after the 25th year of age. This disease rarely develops before the adolescence and after the 40th year of age.\n\nTreatment usually depends on the condition of the disease. An acute abscess is usually controlled with incision and drainage. A chronic pilonidal cyst is best treated with a surgical procedure that involves complete resection of the cyst along with the coexisting fistulas, in order to ensure the minimum reoccurrence rate. There are two choices after surgical resection, secondary intention wound healing or primary trauma closure, with or without a flap. The surgical procedure can be performed with the administration of local anaesthesia in the outpatient office or in a day-clinic, or with the use of general anaesthesia depending on the condition of the patient.\n\nPost operatively secondary intention wound healing is applied in many cases, especially when factors like infection, necrotic tissue or inflammatory tissue are introduced. There are many dressings that can be used for the care of a surgical trauma. The ideal dressing used should have some special characteristics such as absorption of exudates without leakage, provision of a dry environment that prevents bacteria from entering the wound and facilitation of easy appliance, as well as removal. Choosing the right dressing is not based on a certain protocol, but mostly on the surgeon preference.\n\nThe current study aims at comparing two groups of patients that will be subjected to surgical resection of pilonidal cyst and secondary intention wound healing. In the first group, dressings like alginate cord with silver and high G cellulose will be used for filling of the wound cavity and a hydro-capillary dressing for sealing and waterproofing the wound. In the other group, simple gauze dressings for the coverage of the wound cavity will be used. Comparison of the two groups will involve all the endpoints that indicate whether such dressings can facilitate faster wound healing, enabling, thus, patients to faster return to their everyday activities. Furthermore, a parameter that has not been, previously, studied, the quality of life after the surgical excision of the pilonidal cyst, by using the SF - 36 and the Quality of life with Chronic Wound questionnaire, will, also, be investigated.

AB  - Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of paramount importance to human brain function, as the brain relies on a continuous blood supply to meet its energy needs. Blockage of a cerebral blood vessel during the course of surgery, even if transient and short-lived, may result in irreversible brain tissue damage (i.e. stroke) and loss of cortical function, if not identified quickly enough. During neurosurgery, vessel occlusion may occur either inadvertently or as a necessary part of the procedure, and yet current technologies do not adequately predict the consequences of such occlusion. Real-time CBF visualization during surgery could help neurosurgeons better understand the consequences of vascular occlusion events during surgery, recognize potential adverse complications, and thus prompt timely intervention to reduce the risk of stroke. The current standard for visualizing CBF during surgery is indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), which involves administering a bolus of fluorescent dye intravenously and imaging the wash-in of the dye to determine which vessels are perfused. Unfortunately, ICGA can only be used a few times during a surgery due to the need to inject a fluorescent dye, and provides only an instantaneous view of perfusion rather than a continuous view.\n\nPatients will undergo standard craniotomy surgery. The surgical procedures will not be altered in any way by the proposed studies. As long as it is standard of care, neuromonitoring, intraoperative angiogram, and Indocyanine green angiography will be performed by the surgeon. LSCI imaging will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon following exposure of the cortex and will vary from patient to patient depending on the neurosurgical procedure. The LSCI measurements will not add any time to the surgery nor affect the normal operation of the neurosurgical microscope.

The null hypothesis of the study is that there is no significant difference in healing rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life outcomes between MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix and negative pressure dressing cohorts. The alternative hypothesis is that there are differences in healing rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life outcomes between MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix and negative pressure dressing cohorts.\n\nTwenty consecutive patients undergoing surgical excision for Pilonidal Disease will be recruited for treatment. All patients will undergo comparable surgical excision and application of the novel protocol. The wound will be left undisturbed for 10-14 days (until the 1st follow-up visit). At the 1st scheduled postoperative visit, the wound will reassessed in the operative suite, and a second application of the protocol may be performed at the surgeon's discretion. The next follow-up visits will be at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. At these visits, the wound bed will be measured, photo documentation will be captured, and patients will complete a survey to assess quality of life.\n\nStudy Endpoints are:\n\n1. Wound healing at 6 months. Success is defined at a 60% healing rate of epithelialization and wound contracture by volume measurements in centimeters.\n2.

AB  - Pilonidal dermoid is a tubular skin defect which can be seen in both female and male patients between the ages of 12 to 80. Treatment alternatives includes surgical excision. During the surgical treatment local, general, spinal or epidural anesthesia could be applied. However, local anesthesia usually is not preferred due to the fact that pilonidal dermoid sinuses depth, width could not be determined precisely. General anesthesia also is not preferred due to the fact that difficulties arising from patient's positioning and positioning based potential lung related problems. In general, spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia is preferred for pilonidal dermoid sinus surgeries. In this study, the investigators will demonstrate advantages, disadvantages, complications, (sensory and motor block levels), and durations of spinal and epidural anesthesia and superiority of each on these subjects.\n\nPatients who are over 18 and have a America Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical score of I and II will be included in the study. Patients who are pregnant, have a known allergic reactions to local anesthetic and have contraindications against spinal and epidural anesthetic will be excluded from the study.\n\nIn this study the investigators separate the patients into 2 groups. Group1: pilonidal dermoid cyst under Spinal anaesthesia (50 patients).Group 1 will be used in spinal catheter in spinal anesthesia procedures ; Group2:pilonidal dermoid cyst under epidural anaesthesia (50 patient).Group 2 will be used epidural catheter in epidural anaesthesia procedures.

AB  - Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of paramount importance to human brain function, as the brain relies on a continuous blood supply to meet its energy needs. Blockage of a cerebral blood vessel during neurosurgery, even if transient and short-lived, may result in irreversible brain tissue damage (i.e. stroke) and loss of cortical function, if not identified quickly enough.\n\nNeurosurgery involves the treatment of blood-vessel related pathologies within the brain, like intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations and dural arteriovenous fistulas, but also the handling of vessels during brain tumor resections. For these operations, assessment of flow in vessels is of paramount importance. So far, the surgeon can not "see" blood flowing inside the artery or vein. Real-time flow visualization during surgery could help neurosurgeons better understand the consequences of vascular occlusion events during surgery, recognize potential adverse complications, and thus prompt timely intervention to reduce the risk of stroke. The current standard for visualizing flow in arteries during surgery is indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and fluorescein angiography (FA), which involves administering a bolus of fluorescent dye intravenously and imaging the wash-in of the dye to determine which vessels are perfused. Both ICGA and FA provide only a punctual view of perfusion over several seconds, being far away from a continuous assessment.\n\nLaser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has been demonstrated to provide the ability to visualize flow in vessels in real time and continuously without the need for contrast agents. In LSCI, the tissue of interest is illuminated with low power laser light at red or near infrared wavelengths and the light reflected from the tissue surface is imaged onto a camera. The resulting images are laser speckle patterns and a computer processes the images to produce speckle contrast images, which are images of the motion within the field of view (ie, blood flow).\n\nWith these properties LSCI has the potential to deliver for the first time continuous visualisation of blood flow in large and small vessels and to overcome limitations of ICGA and FA. LSCI is an established technique for studies of CBF and has predominantly been used to study microcirculation of the cerebral cortex during neurosurgical procedures. However, the spatial resolution in the clinical setting and its accuracy compared to ICGA and FA are unclear.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the usefulness and accuracy of LSCI compared to ICGA and/or FA during neurovascular surgery. LSCI videos will be recorded automatically intraoperatively in each patient before, during, and after ICGA and/or FA in the same surgical field of view to guarantee comparability of the methods.

AB  - Excision in the midline and primary suture is a long proven method of treating pilonidal sinus. However it's associated with high incidence of post operative infection and recurrence. On the other hand Karydakis operation (excision lateral of the midline, transposition flap and primary suture) is just a slightly more complicated procedure but has five times less recurrences reported in case series. The purpose of the present study is to compare the surgical results and costs of the two surgical methods utilized. In addition the investigators aim to compare the quality of life at defined time points after surgery. Eligible patients are randomized to two groups of surgeons, well trained in either the midline operation or the Karydakis operation (expertise based design). The design of the study allows wide inclusion criteria for participants, a cost-utility approach in the analysis, and a high external validity of the conclusions reached.\n\nComparison: Midline excision andd primary suture compared with the Karydakis operation (excision lateral of the midline and primary suture) for pilonidal disease.

AB  - THEME RELEVANCE. Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (SPD) is a congenital disease that's well spread and constitutes 1-2% of all surgical pathologies. In all Coloproctological pathologies, the disease composes 14-20% (G.I. Vorobjov, 2006; V.D. Fedorov, 2005; Gupta P.J. et al., 2005). Clinical manifestations of pilonidal sinus disease mainly due to the appearance of inflammation in it.\n\nThe main approach in the complex treatment of this group of patients is to execute radical surgery. The guiding principles in it are adequate sanation and drainage of purulent focus.\n\nDespite the fact that this disease is the subject of numerous medical journals, monographs, research works, masters and doctoral theses, frequency of unsatisfactory outcomes remains high (recurrence - from 10% to 19%, wound inflammation - 20-30%). In this case terms of stationary and out-patient treatment increase till 30-70 days (G.I. Vorobjov, 2006; B.M. Dacenko et al., 2004; Cubukcu А., 2001, Perruchoud С, 2002).\n\nThe frequency of unsatisfactory results after excision of SPD directly depends on the kind of surgery. After palliative surgery (incision and drainage of abscess) in 11.7 - 25.2% of patients occurs recurrence of the disease (McCallum I., King P.M., Bruce J., 2007;), for the open wound healing recurrence occur in 3-8% of the operated. For primary wound healing in 7,5-9,7% required re-surgery (V.K. An, 2003; A.A. Kartashev, 2011).\n\nSacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease overwhelmingly affects people, mostly young working age, and treatment failure leads to long-term temporary disability of patients.\n\nIn the last few years continue to discuss methods of one-time or multi-stage radical surgical treatment of pilonidal sinus, but to date there is no single approach to the choice of surgical treatment for this disease (V.L. Denisenko, 2008).\n\nSuccess of surgical treatment of SPD depends on the development and introduction of new devices and techniques exist to produce convergence and immobilization of the wound edges, thereby obtaining its primary healing and a significant reduction of wound surface.\n\nThe high frequency of the disease and postoperative complications, as well as long-term temporary disability of patients demonstrates the relevance of the development of modern methods of radical surgery of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (V.I. Pomazkin, 2008).\n\nAIM OF RESEARCH. The aim of our research is to improve the results of complex radical surgical treatment of patients of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease through the development and introduction of new devices and techniques for convergence and immobilization wound edges.\n\nTASKS OF RESEARCH.\n\n1. To conduct a comparative analysis the most common surgical treatment of SPD in the frequency of complications in the intra- and postoperative periods.\n2. To develop a device for convergence and immobilization wound edges in patients with SPD.\n3. To analyze the effectiveness of the developed techniques and devices in comparison with traditional surgical treatment.\n4. To make practical recommendations on the options and methods of using the developed methods and devices.\n\nNOVELTY OF RESEARCH. For the first time, based on the design and creation of an approximation-immobilization device (RU Patent № 112020, Bull. № 1, 01.10.2012) will be improved the surgical treatment of patients with this pathology, clinical and anatomical study of the proposed device for different configurations of gluteal-sacrococcygeal region, as well as the analysis and justification of the basic parameters of wound (length, depth and width of the wound, the number of stitches, the complication rate , the area of the wound).\n\nDeveloped a method of closure of the wound defect after radical excision of pilonidal sinus by Krivonosov-Brezhnev (RU Patent № 2,464,943, Bull. № 30 from 10.27.12.), that significantly reduces the risk of postoperative complications in patients with acute inflammation of the SPD.\n\nFor the first time an analysis of postoperative period in patients operated with the proposed methods compared with traditional methods of surgery was performed.\n\nPOSSIBLE APPLICATION AREAS. Results of the research designed for use in the treatment process of coloproctological departments at all levels, as well as the learning process of medical schools.\n\nEXPECTED EFFECTIVENESS.\n\n1. Scientific and technical effect: developed new techniques and devices for convergence and immobilization wound edges used for the treatment patients with SPD.\n2. Medical and social effects: the introduction into clinical practice of the developed techniques and devices will improve the results of surgical treatment of patients with SPD by rigid fixation of wound edges, by reducing the time of postoperative wound healing, by decreasing the risk of complications in the early postoperative period.

AB  - Pancreatoduodenectomy is associated with nearly 25% incidence of postoperative complications. One of the most severe complications is a postoperative pancreatic fistula. The exact cause of postoperative fistula development is still unknown, but it appears to be multifactorial. Proper perfusion of pancreatic remnant is essential for the healing of pancreaticojejunostomy. To date, there is no method to reliably evaluate the vascular supply of the remnant. One of the methods for assessment of organ perfusion is the indocyanine green fluorescence. This study aims to determine if indocyanine green fluorescence is a reliable method to measure the perfusion of the post-resection pancreatic remnant. Secondary outcome is to determine, if perioperative evaluation of the vascular supply of the postresection remnant may predict the increased risk of the postoperative pancreatic fistula development.\n\nThis study is designed as a prospective experimental study. All consecutive patients undergoing open pancreaticoduodenectomy at our department in the 1.5.2024-31.12.2026 period will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria are allergy to indocyanine green and refusal by the patient.The adequacy of the vascular supply of the post-resection pancreatic remnant will be perioperatively evaluated using fluorescence detector. Patients will be divided into two groups. Those with hazardous and non-hazardous vascular supply. The incidence of pancreatic fistula in both groups is to be compared. Postoperative data including morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, intensive care unit stay and postoperative fistula development will be collected.\n\nIf a perioperative assessment of the perfusion of post-resection pancreatic remnant using indocyanine green is proven to be a suitable method to estimate the increased risk of the pancreatic fistula, the list of the existing known risk factors could be expanded. In the most high-risk patients the modification of the surgical procedure could be considered.

AB  - Intraoperative sonography is usially used in neurooncology to detect brain tumors and exclude their remnants. A few studies describe it's usage while removing hematomas or vascular malformations. Ultrasound is the only method allowing to observe brain tissue in real time. It is chip and doesn't violate surgical workflow. Main disadvantages of sonography are lengthy learning curve and poorer image quality compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Novel acoustic coupling fluid, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastography expanded it's effectiveness. Meanwhile problems of locating of isoechogenic lesions with poor margins and elimination of artefacts are steel actual.\n\nObjective of the study is to determine possibilities of intraoperative sonography in detecting of various brain mass lesions, assessing extent of their resection and define indications to use ultrasound-guided needle or ultrasound wire-guided port.\n\nA surgeon will intraoperatively locate mass lesion and assess extent of it's resection with sonography. Ultrasound scanning will be performed through the same surgical approach or at a distance through enlarged craniotomy, periodically or permanently. To facilitate approach to subcortical and deep small mass lesions ultrasound-guided needle or ultrasound wire-guided port will be used.

AB  - According to the latest relevant foreign case analysis reports and clinical trial results, the TIP regimen remains the recommended treatment for patients with recurrent and refractory malignant germ-cell tumors based on previous data. Carboplatin has been proven effective and less toxic in children with MGCTs, while cisplatin is more commonly used in early stages. In our research group\&#39;s previously explored TIC scheme (albumin paclitaxel + ifosfamide + carboplatin), cisplatin is often substituted with carboplatin. Additionally, albumin paclitaxel replaces traditional paclitaxel due to its lower adverse reaction rate and higher tumor tissue uptake accumulation, forming the TIC regimen. Our preliminary clinical work has shown that the TIC regimen effectively improves remission rates of recurrent refractory germ cell tumors, particularly yolk sac tumors. For a small number of children who are not responsive to the TIC regimen, combining Sirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) significantly enhances remission rates of recurrent refractory yolk sac tumors. This approach can potentially lead to cure or achieve surgery and radiotherapy within a curative timeframe. Therefore, this study aims to determine the efficacy of combining mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus with the TIC chemotherapy regimen (albumin-paclitaxel + isocyclophosphamide + carboplatin) in treating recurrent or refractory vitelline cyst tumors, providing a novel and effective therapeutic option for children with recurrent and refractory MGCTs.

AB  - Study design and sampling\n\nThis is a prospective study with a randomized double-blind design that will be conducted between October 2015 and October 2016.\n\nPatients scheduled for pilonidal sinus surgery will be included. Patients will be randomly distributed to one of 2 groups with 30 patients in each, using the sealed envelope technique. Group one will receive sacrococcygeal local anesthesia with 75µg/mL of clonidine, while group two will receive sacrococcygeal local anesthesia with 150µg/mL of clonidine.\n\nAnesthetic techniques\n\nBeing a double-blinded study, a specialized nurse will prepare the syringes for each patient.\n\nSacrococcygeal local anesthesia technique\n\nThe Sacrococcygeal block will be performed with the patient in the prone position. Four injection sites are marked on the skin after aseptic preparation.\n\nThe sites are placed as follows: 4 cm below and above the pilonidal sinus and 3 cm lateral to its center on both sides. Therefore a "lozenge" is formed by connecting the 4 sites.\n\nAt first, an injection of 0.3 ml lidocaine 1% is injected at each site using an 8-mm 30G needle. Then 4 injections are admitted to each of the 4 injection sites in turn, with equal supply of the anesthetic mixture in the following manner: a 10-mm 27G needle containing the anesthetic mixture is introduced perpendicularly to the skin and the mixture is infiltrated. The needle is partially withdrawn and reinserted at 45 degrees to the skin aiming towards the center of the pilonidal sinus and an injection will be performed. Then the needle is partially withdrawn again and reinserted at an angle of 45 degrees to the skin aiming at one side of the lozenge then at the other side where injections are done.\n\nIn case of a multiple pilonidal orifices, a hexagon is done. These sites are then anesthetized as previously described.\n\nAnesthetic mixture\n\nFor group 1, the syringe will contain: lidocaine 2% 14 mL, bupivacaine 0.5% 5 mL, and clonidine 0.5 mL with 0.5 mL of saline (thus 75 µg/mL).\n\nAs for group 2, the syringes will contain: lidocaine 2% 14 mL, bupivacaine 0.5% 5 mL, and clonidine 1 mL (thus 150 µg/mL).\n\nDepending on each patient's weight and type of pilonidal sinus, the anesthetic mixture might vary from 30 to 40 mL in total.\n\nData collection\n\nDemographic data, type and duration of surgery will be recorded. Haemodynamics will be registered at all times (pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively).\n\nPain will be assessed using VNRS with 0 being no pain and 10 maximum pain for 48 hours post-operatively.\n\nAs for postoperative analgesia consumption, patients with a VNRS score less than 3 are given paracetamol 1000 mg each 8 hours. If VNRS is between three and four, patients are given Tramadol Hydrochloride 50-100 mg every 4- 6 hours and if the VNRS score is greater or equal to five, patients receive 1 mg/kg Dolosal.\n\nReturn to normal activity will be defined by the ability to sit, walk and work comfortably and will be assessed by calling the patients.

AB  - This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. In this study, 30 patients who underwent endotracheal tumor resection under rigid bronchoscope or stent placement for acquired tracheoesophageal fistula were selected as the subjects. The patients were randomly divided into remazolam general anesthesia group (R group) and propofol general anesthesia control group (P group). Remazolam general anesthesia group (R group): Remazolam 0.4 mg/kg, oxycodone 0.2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg were given for anesthesia induction. Propofol general anesthesia control group (P group): Propofol 1.5mg/kg, oxycodone 0.2mg/kg and rocuronium 0.9mg/kg were given for induction of anesthesia. After induction, high-frequency jet ventilation was used in both groups, the respiratory rate was 30-60 times/min, the inspiratory-to-breath ratio was 1:2, and the driving pressure was 0.8-1.0 KPa. Group R was given remazolam 1mg/kg/h and remifentanil 6-8ug/kg/h for maintenance. Group P was given propofol 4-8 mg/kg/h and remifentanil 6-8ug/kg/h for anesthesia maintenance. The dosage of propofol or remazolam was adjusted according to BIS and intraoperative hemodynamic changes. Rocuronium bromide 10 mg was added every half hour. Intraoperative application of vasoactive drugs to maintain mean arterial pressure above 60mmHg to avoid perioperative hypotension. Blood oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide were monitored to avoid perioperative hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and warm measures were used to maintain the patient's intraoperative body temperature above 36.0°C. After surgery, group R was treated with sugammadex sodium 2-4 mg/kg to antagonize rocuronium bromide, and 0.5 mg of flumazenil was used to antagonize remazolam by intravenous injection; group P was treated with sugammadex 2-4 mg/kg to antagonize rocuronium.

AB  - Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive and safe technique for the treatment of sinonasal disease. Although it is a minimally invasive and less traumatic procedure, it is usually associated with pain of mild to moderate intensity which reaches its maximum level in the first few postoperative hours. However, even low-level postoperative pain may be associated with delayed functional recovery and it frequently contributes to dissatisfaction with the procedure delay in return to work and readmission after surgery. Postoperative analgesia after FESS can be achieved through opioids, NSAIDs, topical or infiltration of local anaesthetic and regional techniques like sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block, infraorbital nerve block and nasociliary block. As the sensory innervations of the SPG supplies the nasal turbinates, nasopharynx and palate, SPG block is expected to provide perioperative analgesia after FESS. Integration of regional anaesthesia with general anaesthesia technique can provide a better hemodynamic control, less perioperative opioid use, less bleeding and higher level of patients' satisfaction. Reduction in surgical bleeding in FESS can improve surgical field and also surgeons' satisfaction and a reduced opioid use may be translated into a less postoperative nausea \& vomiting, rapid recovery and early hospital discharge. But, the current evidences regarding the benefit of SPG block after FESS is controversial. In this randomized controlled trial, efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion block will be evaluated using bupivacaine or ropivacaine as local anaesthetic in adult patients undergoing FESS under general anaesthesia.

AB  - Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), one of the most common vascular malformations, are characterized by abnormally dilated intracranial capillaries resulting in increased susceptibility to hemorrhagic stroke. As an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance, the majority of CCMs gene mutation carriers are largely asymptomatic but when symptoms occur, the disease has typically reached the stage of focal hemorrhage with irreversible brain damage. Currently, the invasive neurosurgery removal of CCM lesions is the only treatment option, despite the recurrence of symptoms after surgery. Therefore, there is a grave need for prognostic/monitoring biomarkers as risk predictors for stroke prevention. The goal is to develop a set of blood prognostic biomarkers as risk predictors for stroke prevention. The objective of this project is to validate novel serum biomarkers identified in Ccm animal models in human blood that could predict the risk of hemorrhagic events. The central hypothesis is that quantitative detection of certain serum biomarkers can be utilized to predict the timing of hemorrhagic events. The hypothesis has been formulated based on the recent findings of five serum etiological biomarkers associated with disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which could lead to hemorrhagic events. Taking advantage of the research team's expertise in Ccm pathology and serum biomarkers, the central hypothesis will be tested to achieve the study goal by pursuing the following three revolutionary aims in two phases, starting from the phase 1 with the first two biomarker discovery aims (1, 2):\n\n1. Validate blood prognostic/monitoring biomarkers with the optimized detection platform for hemorrhagic stroke prevention. The working hypothesis is that expression levels of certain blood molecules are correlated with the progression of a disrupted BBB. In this aim, serum biomarkers identified in Ccms mice will be validated in the blood samples of CCM patients to evaluate their feasibility and reliability. The correlation functions between the serum/plasma levels of biomarkers and the progression of a disrupted BBB identified in Ccms mice will be tested using the "gold standard", enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform in CCM patients for 1a). Clinical preparation for large cohort CCM analysis; 1b). Validating serum progesterone (PRG) as a biomarker, and 1c). Validating 4 etiological serum peptide biomarkers with the optimized ELISA platform in CCM patients.\n2. To optimize the sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range, and reliability of biomarkers using the cutting-edge multiplex platform to predict risks of hemorrhagic stroke. The working hypothesis is that the measurement parameters of blood biomarkers, such as sensitivity, specificity, dynamic working range, and inter/intra variability, can be drastically improved with a larger sample size, improved clinical definitions, and better detection platforms. High-performance ELISAs will be continuously utilized for validating etiological biomarkers. To ensure the highest sensitivity and specificity, a robust automatic multiplex platform for the repetitive analysis of large cohorts is essential to validate biomarkers for hemorrhagic strokes. Linear or logistic regression analysis will be performed to delineate the correlation between validated biomarkers and those of clinical criteria. In this aim, the will 2a). Improve sensitivity and specificity of candidate blood biomarkers through correlation equations were optimized with increased CCM blood sample sizes and updated clinical information; 2b). Define new biomarkers using high-throughput omic approaches, and 2c). Improve sensitivity and increase dynamic working range of blood biomarkers with a multiplex bead array assay (MBAA) platform and optimized protocols.\n\nPhase-2 Aim: 3) Improve clinical utility of validated prognostic/monitoring biomarkers with optimized algorithms in larger cohorts in preparation for human clinical trials. The working hypothesis is that clinical sensitivity and specificity of blood biomarkers can be further improved through a blindly test-retest approach in larger independent human cohorts. This aim will provide sufficient proof that the clinical utility of blood biomarkers can be improved and utilized to predict the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, laying the groundwork for future clinical trials and possible future revolutionary clinical applications. The research team will continue to 3a). Improve clinical utility by optimizing the precision of prognostic/monitoring algorithms of validated biomarker(s)/panel(s) using larger cohorts; 3b). Further improve clinical utility by confirming reliability of validated biomarker(s)/panel(s) in a larger cohort; and 3c). Confirm validated prognostic/monitoring biomarker(s)/panel(s) are ready for future clinical trials.

AB  - Functional images (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), tractography) loaded in neuronavigation are called functional navigation. It is usually combined with anatomical data and allows to display eloquent brain areas. Currently there are plenty of studies concerning possibilities of it's use. In our research we plan to confirm this data and to supplement them with calculating a safe distance from motor areas to various mass lesions in preoperative scans where neurological deficits is not likely to appear after surgery. In case of success this data can be a foundation for further researches specifying indications for use of intraoperative neuromonitoring and possibility of it's replacement with functional navigation in some cases.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to assess accuracy, advantages of functional neuronavigation and calculate safe distance from motor areas to brain tumors and vascular malformations in image-guided surgery. For each patient a surgeon intraoperatively will assess locations of motor cortex and corticospinal tract found with direct cortical and subcortical stimulation and capture them. After surgery he will compare this data with functional preoperative scans and virtual motor centers constructed based on tractography. Influence of various factors on precision of functional navigation will be studied and safe distance between motor brain areas and mass lesion borders will be calculated.

AB  - In patients with refractory CRSwNP, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), is intended to restore physiologic sinus ventilation and drainage, which can facilitate the gradual resolution of mucosal disease. However, because FESS does not directly treat the underlying inflammatory disorder, a successful sinus surgery must be followed by medical maintenance therapy to control inflammatory processes.\n\nThe current mainstay of treatment of CRSwNP includes antibiotics and topical and systemic steroids. There is evidence that administration of systemic steroids in the postoperative period for patients who have polyps may have a significant impact on their postoperative course. However, the chance of significant side effects increases with the dose and duration of treatment and therefore the minimum dose necessary to control the disease should be given. Antibiotics also have their limited but documented side effects and can induce resistance.\n\nA semi-natural product like manuka honey (brand name MEDIHONEY®), with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, might prove as a useful alternative since it has no major adverse events documented in the literature, does not induce resistance and is effective against resistant pathogens common in this patient population.\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized, pilot clinical trial that will determine if the use of MEDIHONEY® sinus rinses (alone or in combination with intranasal steroids) in the postoperative period enhances recovery and prevents polyp recurrence in patients after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), compared with the standard regimen of topical corticosteroid sinus rinses. The study will collect and compare subjective and objective efficacy assessments of both types of rinses.

AB  - Pilonidal disease derives its name from Latin- pilus meaning "hair," and nidus meaning "nest" . The source of pilonidal disease is thought to be a deep intergluteal sulcus. It is widely accepted that the establishment of the pilonidal sinus results from the penetration of shed hair shafts through the skin, which ultimately leads to an acute or chronic infected site .\n\nPilonidal disease is largely considered a surgical disease, especially in acute instances with secondary infection and abscess. Infection or abscess requires incision and drainage. Definitive treatment is delayed the majority of the time if there is an acute infection or abscess until after the infection has been addressed. Surgical options for chronic disease are numerous and can include "pit picking," curettage, aspiration, unroofing, or surgical excision. Defects can be closed primarily, with flaps or grafts, or allowed to heal by secondary intention .\n\nThe most serious problem of the various surgical approaches proposed is the recurrence rate, ranging from 0% to 40% .\n\nThe surgical treatment of patients with recurrent disease does not differ from the surgical treatment of primary pilonidal disease. In case of a recurrence with an abscess, incision and drainage prevail, while in case of chronic recurrent disease, a flap based procedure may be indicated following sinus excision with scarring, like the rhomboid flap .

AB  - The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to establish the efficacy of 'pit picking with laser therapy' versus 'pit picking alone' on both short and long-term outcomes in patients of 12 years and older with primary pilonidal sinus disease.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* The overall success rate of treatment which is defined as: closure of all pits at 12 months of follow-up.\n* Secondary endpoints: succes rat eof treatment during long-term follow-up, wound closure time, pain scores, complication rate, work rehabilitation, time to return to daily activities, quality of life, persisting complaints, patient satisfaction, costs and the need for secondary or revision surgery.\n\nParticipants will allocated to pit picking alone or combined with lasertherapy.\n\nThe extra burden for participating patients is expected to be minimal to moderate. Participants will have two extra hospital visits in casethey are enrolled in our study: 6 and 12 months after enrolment. Postoperatively the normal scheme of follow up appointments wil be used: 2 and 6 weeks after treatment at the outpatient clinic of the treating surgeon. A telephone appointment with the researcher will be scheduled 4 weeks after treatment. Patients are asked to complete questionnaires at various time points, which will be sentto them by email and will take approximately 5-10 minutes each time. The content includes general and disease specific Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires. The investigators do not expect any extra adverse reactions or events in respect to participation in the study because both procedures are considered standard of care in the participating clinics. However, because both interventions are surgical procedures a small percentage of adverse events or postoperative complications can be expected.

AB  - Pancreatic Fistula (PF) remains the main complication following pancreatic surgery with an incidence described in up to 45% of cases, even in high volume centers. It can determine the onset of other complications such as abdominal abscesses, surgical wound infections, sepsis and bleeding, sometimes fatal. In addition, the economic impact due to the extension of hospital stay and the management costs of the PF are not of secondary importance.\n\nThe International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGFP) has standardized the definition of PF identifying it as "the leak from a surgical or percutaneous drainage of any measurable quantity of fluid, starting from the third postoperative day (POD3), with an amylase content three times higher than the upper normal limit of serum amylases. " However, according to this definition, all patients who satisfy this condition, even in the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms, are defined as suffering from pancreatic fistula.\n\nTo overcome this, a three grades classification system of PF was introduced, based on the clinical impact:\n\n* Grade A: It is biochemical fistula; No intervention needed, not significant change of the post-operative hospital stay.\n* Grade B: it requires an extension of the post-operative hospital stay, the permanence of surgical drains, the possible positioning of further drainages under radiological guide, antibiotic therapy and the use of artificial, enteral or parenteral nutrition;\n* grade C: re-surgery is needed. Grade B and C represent clinically relevant fistulas. It is therefore evident that a correct definition of PF and its grade (A, B, C) can only be formulated "a posteriori".\n\nHowever, considering the high prognostic impact of PF, it is needful to identify risk factors and diagnostic tools capable of stratifying patients at risk of pancreatic fistula and reach an early diagnosis in order to plan better plan both the treatment of it and the complications that may arise.\n\nMany authors assume that the main predictive factor of PF is represented by the level of amylases in the abdominal drainage fluid, at different cut-offs and on different postoperative days. Others assume that abdominal drainage itself determines the development of PF and other complications.\n\nMolinari has shown that a level of amylase in the abdominal drainage fluid \<5000 IU / L in POD1 identifies a subgroup of patients at low risk of PF in which abdominal drainage is unfavorable to maintain. In Molinari's work, however, patients with PF grade A were also considered.\n\nIn his experience, Fong has identified a high-risk of PF subgroup in patients underwent DCP with an amylase level in abdominal drainage fluid \> 600 IU / L in POD1. The author therefore proposed the immediate removal of abdominal drainage in patients considered low risk.\n\nOne of the most consistent bias of the Fong study is that in some patients there was an intrapancreatic drainage connected to the outside. Recently, Seykora has shown how in patients underwent DCP it is possible to use different amylase level cutoffs on drainage fluid in POD1, POD3 and POD5 in order to predict the clinically relevant PF risk and modulate the management of surgical drainages.\n\nOne of the limitations of the cut-offs identified by Seykora is represented by the fact that they have been identified considering their negative predictive value rather than their positive predictive value.\n\nIn a study recently conducted at Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome, Caputo confirmed that the dosage of amylase on the abdominal drainage fluid represents the most important clinically relevant predictor of PF and has confirmed, as underlined by Seykora, that the management of abdominal drainage is necessarily a dynamic process conditioned mainly by the serial dosage of amylases on drainage liquid (POD1-3).\n\nFurthermore, in the Caputo's work, cut-offs of amylases on the abdominal drainage liquid (\> 666 IU / L in POD1 and\> 252 IU / L in POD3) have been identified as able to predict more than 80% of the clinically relevant PF. It has also been shown that the value of the amylases on the abdominal drainage fluid in POD3\> 207 IU / L and the presence of an abdominal collection of dimensions equal to or greater than 5 cm in the abdomen CT without contrast performed on the same day significantly correlates with the risk of developing a biliary fistula.\n\nIf confirmed by this study, the practice of maintaining drainage in place up to POD3 could be validated. Drainages could be removed in POD3 in case of amylase levels in POD1 \<666 U / L and amylase levels in POD3 \<252 U / L except in cases where the amylase levels in POD3 are ≥ 207 and for which the routine use of abdominal CT on the same day seems to be justified in order to detect abdominal collections ≥ 5 cm which confirm the risk of this complication. In this latter category of patients, considering the risk of biliary fistula, drainages could be maintained beyond POD3.

AB  - This is a single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized study. Patients are screened and included during the emergency room consultation or a scheduled consultation. After verification of the selection criteria and provision of clear, fair and appropriate information, patients are offered to participate in the study. If they accept, consent is signed and randomization is carried out.\n\nThe procedure under study is puncture/aspiration. Local anesthesia is previously carried out with 2-5 cc of 1% lidocaine. The puncture is then carried out using a 16 gauge needle. Antibiotic coverage will be offered. A work stoppage is recommended until the day after the puncture/aspiration but the duration is left to the discretion of the surgeon. The patient is systematically reviewed 15 days after the puncture/aspiration with a recommendation for earlier consultation in the event of persistence of redness, discharge, pain or onset of fever. If these symptoms recur or persist, it is recommended to make an incision with packing. In the event of fistulization following the puncture, associated with discharge and skin necrosis, local nursing care is recommended. The definitive resection procedure is then planned 4 to 6 weeks after the puncture/aspiration if the evolution is favorable.\n\nThe gold standard procedure is incision of the abscess. This is carried out according to the habits of the department: in the operating room under general or local anesthesia or in consultation (or emergencies) under local anesthesia. The procedure is carried out on an outpatient basis but, if necessary, short-term hospitalization is carried out. Daily wicking is then carried out with nursing care at home until healing. A work stoppage is recommended for a period of approximately 10 days. The patient is systematically reviewed at 15 days with a recommendation for earlier consultation in the event of persistence of redness, discharge, pain or onset of fever. If these symptoms recur or persist, it is recommended to make an incision with packing. The definitive resection procedure is then planned 4 to 6 weeks after the initial operation if the evolution is favorable.\n\nThe definitive resection procedure is carried out after the flattening of the abscess has healed. It is recommended to perform resection without closure with nursing-care healing at home with daily packings for 15 days. After the 15-day visit, changing the dressings by wicking is recommended daily until healing.

AB  - Sacrococcygeal Pilonidal disease is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue at or near the upper part of the natal cleft of the buttocks. Pilonidal cavities are not true cysts and lack a fully epithelialized lining; however, the sinus tracts may be epithelialized.\n\nPilonidal sinus disease (PNS) has an incidence of approximately 26 per 100,000 population with a male predominance of 2:1 and the mean age of those affected is from 19 to 30 years of age. It occurs rarely after the age of 45 and children.\n\nPilonidal sinus disease is characterized by natal cleft suppuration due to hair follicle infection. The disease results from chronic infection of hair follicles and subsequent formation of a subcutaneous abscess because of persistent folliculitis. Hair then enters the abscess cavity and provokes a foreign body tissue reaction; chronic suppuration and discharge through a midline sinus follow.\n\nSome individuals are asymptomatic with midline pits in the sacrococcygeal area, Symptomatic Pilonidal sinus results in chronic discharging wounds that cause pain and impact upon quality of life and social function. These sinuses may become infected and present as acute abscesses. Management of these abscesses is uncontroversial and revolves around incision and drainage, however, the mode of surgical management of the chronic discharging sinus is variable, contentious, and problematic.\n\nThe Principles of Surgical strategies require eradication of the sinus tract, complete healing of the overlying skin, and prevention of recurrence. Many methods are available for surgical management of PNS which is treated by wide excision. After excision, the wound may be left open to heal with granulation tissue, or may be immediate closed with a midline closure or by using a flap (Z-plasty, karydakis, Bascom or Rhomboid flaps). However, there is not yet a consensus on the optimal treatment.\n\nExcision and healing by granulation is still preferred due to the low recurrence rate of (3.4%) compering with other methods (20.6%) for midline closure and (10.3%) for off-midline closure but the healing time is lengthy and requires a prolonged time of daily dressing with a risk of infection and delayed wound healing. Therefore, the search for a treatment with minimal pain, accelerated healing time and a short span of time for returning to the normal daily activities is vastly pursued.\n\nA recent method to promote the wound-healing process is the local administration of an autologous platelet concentrate suspended in plasma named as platelet rich plasma (PRP) which contains growth factors. Concentrated growth factors have been reported to accelerate wound healing by 30-40% giving a satisfactory outcome in the treatment of chronic skin and soft tissue lesions, maxillofacial and plastic surgeries by presenting these high amounts of growth factors and chemokines.\n\nWhen platelets become activated, Seven fundamental protein growth factors that are actively secreted by platelet initiate all wound healing process, including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) \& insulin like growth factor (ILGF 1) all participate in the acceleration of wound-healing process.

AB  - Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease is a chronic subcutaneous tissue inflammation that most commonly affects the male sex between the ages of 20 and 30, characterized by burning, itching and discharge in the internal gluteal cleft. It affects the young working population, short return to work after treatment and early return to daily normal activity is socioeconomically important. Although approximately 15 different surgical techniques have been described in the literature in the treatment of pilonidal sinus, a gold standard approach has not been determined. Since it is seen in the young working population, it is important that the ideal treatment has an easy-to-apply, low cost and fast recovery process. The effectiveness of phenol administration as a minimally invasive procedure has been demonstrated with acceptable complication and success rates in prospective and retrospective studies.\n\nSilver nitrate is a caustic and sclerosing substance that impairs tract integrity, such as phenol. It supports the closure of the sinus tract by cauterizing the granulation and epithelialized tissue throughout the sinus. It also has antimicrobial properties to reduce microbial load throughout the tract. Although the effective use and successful results of silver nitrate in the treatment of perianal fistula have been shown, a prospective study has not been conducted yet on the use of pilonidal sinus.\n\nThe main purpose of the study is to compare return to normal daily activity between the two groups. This period will be measured in days from the intervention. Participants will not be offered any restrictions after the intervention, and the period of returning to normal daily activities such as starting work at work or doing the housework will be determined by filling out a two-week daily questionnaire. Secondary goals; quality of life, complaints related to pilonidal sinus (itching, burning, discharge), wound infection, closure of pilonidal sinus mouth, recurrence rate and VAS (visual analog scale) scoring.

Pre-operative patients complete the questionnaire prior to surgery (during preoperative appointment) and again at least 1 month after surgery (via mail). Data are analyzed to determine the most valid grouping of items into measurement scales for development of the final instrument.\n* Part 3 (psychometric evaluation of the patient-reported outcome questionnaire): Post-operative patients complete 2 copies of the questionnaires in clinic or by mail approximately 2 weeks apart. They also complete several other well-established, validated instruments used to measure patient-reported quality of life and symptomatology in order to aid in the evaluation of convergent and discriminant validity. Pre-operative patients complete the final questionnaire prior to surgery (during preoperative appointment) and again at least 1 month after surgery by mail or in clinic.

AB  - Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD or Whipple procedure) involves the removal of the head of the pancreas and is the primary modality for treatment of peri-ampullary cancers (arising from the common bile duct, Ampulla of Vater, duodenum, neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, and most commonly the exocrine pancreas). In Canada, cancer of the pancreas is the 11th cancer in terms of new cases/year, and the 5th leading cause of cancer related deaths/year. Following PD the remaining pancreas is re-connected to a portion of the gastrointestinal tract; the pancreas is very soft and difficult to sew and connect safely. The primary cause of complications following PD is related to leak occurring at this connection. Of patients that develop a leak, over half need a second operation, and up to 40% will die. The two main organs that the pancreas may be re-connected to are the jejunum or the stomach. The investigators will compare the rates of pancreatic leakage in two groups of patients randomized to reconnection to either the jejunum or stomach following PD. The goal of this study is to determine which of these methods is safer. The results may change practice patterns across North America and the world. It may in the future prevent many cases of avoidable leakage and the resulting morbidity of this including death. This will therefore reduce the morbidity and mortality of this group of cancer patients.

AB  - The standard treatment at Nordsjællands Hospital in Hillerød (NOH) has since 2007 been Bascom's pit-pick procedure (PP) for simple pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), while Bascom's cleft-lift procedure has been performed in complicated cases not suitable for PP operation, recurrences following previous excisions, including PP, and unhealed midline wounds. PP operation is a minimally invasive procedure performed using local anesthesia in day surgery or outpatient clinic with certain advantages such as quick healing, less pain and a quick return to work as well as cosmetic advantages with no change to the overall appearance and shape of the gluteal cleft. The procedure is less resource demanding requiring fewer staff members and less time spent at the hospital as well as a quick return to daily life. Short-term studies showing great results following PP operation have previously been published, but so far, no long-term results have been published regarding Danish patients. Furthermore, it has previously been stated that most recurrences happen within the first 5 years following surgery. A follow-up of at least 5 years after surgery for PSD has been proposed as the gold standard. A longer follow-up is warranted to fully understand, whether PP procedure is a fully adequate treatment with an acceptable rate of recurrence and patient satisfaction or whether it only delays the time before the patients eventually undergo a final treatment.\n\nThe study is based on data of patients in a local pilonidal database. The patients in the database have all undergone surgery for pilonidal sinus disease at NOH during the period of 2007 to 2014. Data in the database has been collected prospectively up to one year following surgery and subsequently supplemented with data collected by questionnaire and telephone interviews for the period from one year follow-up and until the date of long-term follow-up. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at NOH.\n\nPatients receive a REDCap survey per e-mail to a personal digital mailbox or are asked to participate in a telephone interview to fill out a standardized questionnaire. Patients without a personal digital mailbox receive the questionnaire by regular mail. The survey is sent out twice with a four-week interval. Only patients who do not fill out the questionnaire the first time, receive the survey a second time as a reminder. Telephone interviews are only conducted, if patients do not reply to the questionnaire received digitally or as a physical copy. The questionnaire includes questions regarding demographic characteristics, lifestyle, complications, recurrence and new interventions, pain, and cosmetic satisfaction. Medical records are reviewed to verify answers from the questionnaire if consent by the patient is given through the survey or during the telephone interview. Patients experiencing symptoms of recurrence, are offered an assessment at the hospital.\n\nThe surgical intervention: the patient is placed in a prone position and the natal cleft is kept open using tape straps. Local analgesia is administered around the midline pits and at the site of the planned lateral incision using lidocaine 5 mg/ml with adrenaline 5 µg/ml. Occasionally the procedure was performed under general anesthesia. All midline pits are identified and excised using a scalpel removing hairs and infected granulation tissue. To drain the sinus, a lateral incision is made about 1-2 cm from the midline on the most appropriate side and through this incision underlying sinuses are either curetted or excised. Additional secondary pits are removed as part of the lateral incision. Midline wounds and separately excised secondary pits close to the midline are closed with suture using transcutaneous polypropylene 3-0 or 4-0 madras suture, while the lateral incision is left open and covered with bandage and transparent film dressing to heal by secondary intention.\n\nRisk of recurrence and time to complete wound healing is analyzed using competing risk analysis as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses including the following risk factors: sex, age, smoking, BMI, relevant co-morbidities, diabetes mellitus, acne, hidradenitis, previous interventions, preoperative abscess, number of primary and secondary pits, number of lateral incisions and postoperative complications. Remaining outcomes are analyzed as categorical variables using descriptive data analyses.

AB  - Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a common chronic disease that generally affects young adults below the age of 45. It is most commonly observed at the inter-gluteal region, though it may also affect other sites like the umbilicus and the inter-digital area, particularly among in barbers. The disease was long thought to be either congenital or acquired; although in recent years it has been more widely viewed as an acquired disease. The etiology of PSD is not fully understood, however, the most important cause is believed to be fallen hairs accumulating within skin folds and implanting within the skin. The skin becomes more prone to maceration, sweating and bacterial contamination, which facilitates implantation of fallen hairs, creating the necessary conditions for development of the disease. Although PSD is a benign disease, it produces symptoms such as pain and discharge, which adversely affect patient quality of life.\n\nThere are many approaches for treatment of the disease, including several surgical methods such as limited or large excision, primary closure, or flap techniques, and many other non-surgical methods. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the ideal treatment method. An ideal surgical treatment reduces recurrence and complication rates, and allows for minimal hospitalization and rapid return to daily activities. Among patients treated using the limited excision and primary closure method, the presence of a natal cleft is associated with higher morbidity, resulting in recurrence rates of 7-42%. For techniques that use the flap approach, this rate decreases to 0-3%. In patients undergoing the Rhomboid excision and Limberg flap techniques, which require a larger surgical area compared to the limited excision and primary closure methods, complication rates are lower, and length of hospital-stay and time to return to work are reduced. However, using the classical Limberg flap technique, maceration and scar formation due to sutures in the inter-gluteal sulcus, and the accumulation of hair at the midline may result in recurrence. Application of a modified Limberg technique that includes lateralization of the middle line can help reduce wound complications and recurrence rates. Several publications report contradicting results regarding surgical outcomes using the same technique, which may be attributable to differences in practice between surgeons. Therefore, it can be logical to explore the superiority of any type of surgical technique performed by the same surgeon for the surgical treatment of pilonidal sinus disease.

AB  - Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a chronic and inflammatory disease that is often generated in the sacrococcygeal region. It is commonly observed in puberty and young adult period and usually affects men. The incidence of pilonidal sinus disease is 26:100,000 and rising globally.\n\nPSD risk factors contain young age, obesity, male gender, Mediterranean ethnicity, deep natal cleft, hairiness, and poor hygiene. It has been shown that PSD incidence increases in parallel with body weight. The precise etiology of pilonidal sinus disease is unclear. Many conservative and surgical methods have been described in treating pilonidal sinus disease. After the sinus area is excised, excision with laying open (secondary healing), excision with primary closure, marsupialization, and various flap techniques can be applied in surgical treatment. The primary principle in treatment is to ensure that the patient returns to normal life as soon as possible and eliminate recurrences. Although the best surgical technique in treating pilonidal sinus is controversial, the ideal operation should be cost-effective, simple to perform, short hospital stay, and have a low recurrence and complication rates. There is no definite consensus on an ideal technique yet.\n\nIn this study, we aim to compare the Karydakis flap and Burow's Triangle Advancement Flap techniques applied in the surgical treatment of pilonidal sinus in our clinic in terms of complications (wound dehiscence, seroma, hematoma, surgical site infection), time to return to normal activity, and recurrence.

AB  - This acquired disease is caused by negative suction of the hair present in the natal cleft region, leading to a foreign body reaction and subsequent granuloma . It affects 26 per 100000 people, and it mainly affects young men . Surgery for PND is frequently performed in Egypt by general surgeons, with no published data regarding its incidence or prevalence in the Egyptian population.\n\nThe PND patient may report different presentations ranging from asymptomatic disease to acute infection and abscess formation. Others may have a chronic disease with recurrent perianal inflammation and discharge.\n\nMultiple surgical options have been described for chronic PND. However, no technique has been universally accepted. The idea of any procedure is to excise the pits with the related sinus tracts leaving healthy tissue as possible to decrease recurrence. The most commonly performed surgical techniques include excision with either primary closure, lay open, or flap-based reconstruction.

AB  - BACKGROUND\n\nPilonidal disease refers to a common disease affecting mostly young males. It may present as asymptomatic pits, acute and painful abscess formation, or chronic discharging sinuses. There are many treatment options for the latter two manifestations but broadly speaking the surgical treatment of acute pilonidal abscess can fall into three categories: (1) incision and drainage, (2) de-roofing and curettage and (3) wide local excision.\n\nSome authors believe that the incision and drainage method is an effective procedure. However, this method would treat only the acute infection and produce the necessity of re-operation for definite therapy. The alternative method is wide local excision in which the patients receive definite therapy in a single staged operation reducing the number of operations per patient, patient visits to hospital and overall cost to the health service. However, concerns over the length of time to gain acceptable wound healing following wide local excision has decreased its popularity with some surgeons. There is limited evidence available for the surgical management of acute pilonidal abscess which has lead to disagreement as to what is the best option. One randomised study of 76 patients compared incision and drainage of acute pilonidal abscess followed by an elective excision of the pilonidal sinus and primary closure at 3 weeks versus wide local excision with the wound left open for secondary healing. At 12 months the incision and drainage followed by elective excision group had 14% recurrence of pilonidal abscess whereas the wide local excision group had 0% recurrence. Another randomised study of 131 patients compared incision and drainage versus abscess excision (de-roofing) with curettage for acute pilonidal abscess and found recurrence rates of 42% in the incision and drainage group verses 11% in the curettage group. A prospective randomised study similarly compared incision and drainage versus abscess excision (de-roofing) with curettage for acute pilonidal abscess and reported a significantly higher rate of developing a chronic pilonidal sinus in the incision and drainage group (76% vs 24%, p\<0.001). A retrospective study with median follow up of 5.3 years has recently been published comparing abscess de-roofing with curettage and wide local excision for acute pilonidal abscess. The authors reported an approximate three-fold increase in recurrence rate in the curettage group compared with the wide local excision group.\n\nRATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY\n\nThe evidence available for the surgical management of acute pilonidal abscess is limited. Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that incision and drainage results in high recurrence rates and should not be considered as the first-line treatment option for the management of acute pilonidal abscess. However, it is not clear whether abscess de-roofing with curettage or wide local excision should be considered as the surgical procedure of choice in acute pilonidal abscess. There has not been a prospective randomised study comparing abscess de-roofing with curettage and wide local excision for acute pilonidal abscess. The ideal surgical procedure would be one that results in the lowest rate of abscess recurrence, treats the underlying pilonidal sinus thereby reducing the need for re-operation but has acceptable post-operative pain, complications and time to complete wound healing.\n\nResearch question:\n\nDoes wide local excision when compared to abscess excision (de-roofing) with curettage result in reduced recurrence rates and therefore provide a single-stage procedure for the management of acute pilonidal abscess and the underlying causative sinus? Is wide local excision when compared to abscess de-roofing with curettage a safe procedure in terms of complications (bleeding, wound infection), post-operative pain and time to complete wound healing?\n\nHypothesis:\n\nWide local excision for the management of acute pilonidal abscess results in lower recurrence rates when compared with abscess de-roofing with curettage. Post-operative pain, complications and time to complete wound healing will not be significantly different between the two treatment groups.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\nTo compare therapeutic values of abscess de-roofing with curettage versus wide local excision in the surgical treatment of patients with acute pilonidal abscess. Therapeutic values include: recurrence rate, post-operative pain, time to complete wound healing, time to returning to work or normal daily activities and complications of surgery (bleeding and wound infection).\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nTo assess the practicality of abscess de-roofing with curettage and wide local excision in the surgical treatment of patients with acute pilonidal abscess in terms of operative time and total time in theatre.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\nType of study: Single centre randomised controlled clinical trial\n\nStudy design:\n\nPatients with acute pilonidal abscess will be randomised into 2 treatment groups. Randomisation of patients will be performed by the surgical registrar on call for either admissions or the emergency theatre. The method of randomisation will be by identical sealed envelopes. The principle investigator (Lalin Navaratne) will create trial packs within identical sealed envelopes. These packs will contain:\n\n1. Patient information sheet (PIS)\n2. 3 copies of the patient consent form (for the study)\n3. A consent form for the operation (Consent Form 1)\n4. Information sheet to the operating surgeon outlining which treatment arm the patient has been allocated to\n5. The data collection sheet(s) for demographic data, medical history, smoking history, previous pilonidal disease history, operative data, and follow up data\n6. Letter to GP\n\nThe sealed envelopes will be created in blocks of 20 (10 for each treatment arm) to keep the groups of similar size during the study. Once the 20 envelopes have been created and sealed (with a signed white label) they will be shuffled by another investigator who has not been involved in creating the packs and placed in a secure location (locked filing cabinet within the surgical assessment unit). When a patient has been referred to the emergency surgery unit they will be seen on the surgical assessment unit and will be invited to join the study if inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met. The patient will be given the Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and have adequate time to read it. Once the patient has read the PIS and had an opportunity to ask any questions they will be enrolled into the study if applicable. The surgeon will take the trial pack 'on the top of the pile' within the secured filing cabinet which will randomly allocate the patient to one of two treatment arms. The two treatment arms are: (1) de-roofing and curettage and (2) wide local excision. The surgeon will complete any data collection requirements at this stage and all documentation will remain in the envelope and be tracked with the patients notes.\n\nThe two arms of this trial will be performed in the operating theatre with the patient under general anaesthesia. The surgical technique for each treatment arm is detailed below:\n\n1. Abscess de-roofing and curettage. The patient will be placed in the lateral position with the buttocks spread apart using tape. The cleft of the buttocks will be shaved prior to cleaning and preparation of the skin. A spindle-shaped (elliptical) excision will be performed to the lateral aspect of the abscess formation with a scalpel staying away from the midline. Once the pus has been drained through this lateral incision the wound cavity will then be curetted and washed out with hydrogen peroxide. The wound size will be measured by the operating surgeon who will record the maximal length and width of the wound. Once haemostasis (cessation of any bleeding) is achieved the wound will be packed with Kaltostat ribbon and the wound dressed with blue gauze and mefix tape. The wound is therefore left open.\n2. Wide local excision. Patients will be placed in the prone position with the buttocks spread apart using tape. The cleft of the buttocks will be shaved prior to cleaning and preparation of the skin. Diluted methylene blue will be injected in all visible pits and a wide spindle-shaped (elliptical) midline excision of the skin and the underlying subcutaneous tissue down to the coccygeal (pre-sacral) fascia including all sinuses will be performed with electrocautery. The specimen will be sent for histology as per routine surgical practice. The wound will be washed with hydrogen peroxide. The wound size will be measured by the operating surgeon who will record the maximal length and width of the wound. Once haemostasis (cessation of any bleeding) is achieved the wound will be packed with Kaltostat ribbon and the wound dressed with blue gauze and mefix tape. The wound is therefore left open.\n\nPatients will not be routinely prescribed any antibiotics following the operation. All patients will have wound packing for the first 24 hours after the operation. For patients within the drainage and curettage group no further packing is usually required. Patients discharged the same day of surgery will have their packing removed and wound reviewed in the community. Patients who stay in-hospital overnight following their surgery will have their packing removed and wound reviewed in-hospital prior to discharge. For patients within the wide local excision group, packing may be required following the first post-operative day and packing is continued until no longer indicated. Dressing changes for these patients will occur in the community.\n\nAll patients will be advised to cleanse the wounds in the shower at least once a day and will be followed up in a dedicated wound clinic weekly until their wounds have healed. After healing, they will be followed up in a telephone clinic at 6 and then 12 months. When attending the wound clinic, data will be collected on abscess recurrence, time to wound healing, number of days until the patient can return to work (or when they resumed normal daily activities), pain scores, wound size and any signs of wound infection. Further follow up in the main outpatient department will monitor for abscess recurrence. With patient consent, non-identifying photographs may be taken of the wound during the operation and the subsequent healing process during the follow up period.\n\nAny patient enrolled within the study may re-present with an acute abscess recurrence within the follow up period of one year. If the patient belongs to the de-roof and curettage group, they would be offered a wide local excision as the surgical management of choice. If the patient belongs to the wide local excision group, then they would be offered further drainage and curettage or wide local excision based on what the attending surgeon feels is the best surgical option for that particular patient. Analysis would be by intention to treat. Any patient re-operated on during the study period would not need to be followed up in the weekly wound clinic for the purposes of data collection (time to healing, time to returning to work, pain scores, wound size etc). These patients would be followed up in the outpatient clinic as per departmental standard operating procedures.
