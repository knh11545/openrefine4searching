AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) has a worst prognosis with little progress in terms of survival for the last two decades. Immunology received little interest in EOC in the past, but now appears very important in the natural history of this cancer. This review is an EOC immunology state of art and focuses on the place of immunotherapy in future. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of published studies was performed. Medline baseline interrogation was performed with the following keywords: "Ovarian carinoma, immunotherapy, T-lymphocyte, regulator T-lymphocyte, dendritic cells, macrophage, antigen, chemotherapy, surgery, clinical trials". Identified publications (English or French) were assessed for the understanding of EOC immunology and the place of conventional treatment and immunotherapy strategy. RESULTS: Intratumoral infiltration by immune cells is a strong prognotic factor in EOC. Surgery and chemotherapy in EOC decrease imunosuppression in patients. The antitumoral immunity is a part of the therapeutic action of surgery and chemotherapy. Until now, immunotherapy gave some disappointing results, but the new drugs that target the tolerogenic tumoral microenvironnement rise and give a new hope in the treatment of cancer. CONCLUSION: Immunology controls the EOC natural history. The modulation of immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with the stimulation of antitumoral immunity could be the next revolution in the treatment of cancer.

AB  - Colorectal carcinoma during pregnancy is very rare. Prognosis is severe because of the advanced stage due to delay in diagnosis and the aggressiveness of this widespread metastatic disease. We report the case of colon metaststic adenocarcinoma during a twin pregnancy with a good outcome. In the light of epidemiology, pathogeny and immunology, the diagnostic challenge for clinicians is distinguishing pregnancy symptoms from the warning signs of colorectal cancer and, we describe recommended medical and surgical management.

TI  - Towards therapeutic vaccines for colorectal carcinoma: a review of clinical trials.

AB  - Colorectal carcinoma is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Despite the introduction of new cytotoxic drugs, improved surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques, a large proportion of colorectal carcinomas remain incurable. New targeted therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, are being explored as complementary treatments. Recent advances in immunology and molecular biology have opened new avenues for the clinical testing of rationally designed vaccination strategies against cancer. The present report reviews the results of therapeutic vaccine trials in colorectal carcinoma, published mainly in the past 6 years. Tumor-associated antigens (self-antigens) have been targeted by therapeutic vaccination in more than 2000 colorectal carcinoma patients. The results demonstrate that tumor antigen-specific immune responses are reproducibly induced; that is, tolerance can be reversed, without the induction of serious adverse events or autoimmune disorders. No long-term autoimmune side effects have been observed after a minimum follow-up of 4 years in over 700 patients. Over 1300 colorectal carcinoma patients with minimal residual disease have been enrolled in randomized controlled Phase II/III trials using autologous tumor cell vaccines. A significantly improved overall survival was noted for Stages I-IV colorectal carcinoma patients utilizing Newcastle-disease virus as an adjuvant. Autologous tumor cells mixed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were of significant clinical benefit for patients with Stage II colon cancer. Results of randomized controlled trials targeting Ep-CAM have shown clinical benefit in subgroups of patients. Several new generation vaccines have demonstrated excellent safety profile and immunogenicity. Some studies have also demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the induced immune response and prolonged overall survival, which should be confirmed in enlarged trials. Although it is unlikely that active specific immunotherapy will provide a standard complementary therapeutic approach for colorectal carcinoma in the near future, the results so far are encouraging. Randomized controlled vaccine trials targeting molecularly defined tumor antigens are warranted, particularly in colon carcinoma with minimal residual disease.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate whether major abdominal surgery leads to complement activation and interleukin response and whether the kind of anaesthesia influence complement activation and the release of inflammatory interleukins. The study design was prospective and randomised. Fifty patients undergoing open major colorectal surgery due to cancer disease or inflammatory bowel disease were studied. Twenty‐five patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, and 25 patients were given inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. To determine complement activation (C3a and SC5b‐9) and the release of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor‐a (TNF‐a)), interleukin‐1b (IL‐1b), IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐4 and IL‐10), blood samples were drawn preoperatively, 60 minutes after start of surgery, 30 minutes after end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Complement was activated and pro‐inflammatory interleukins (IL‐6 and IL‐8) and anti‐inflammatory interleukins (IL‐10) were released during major colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference between TIVA and inhalational anaesthesia regarding complement activation and cytokine release. Major colorectal surgery leads to activation of the complement cascade and the release of both pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory cytokines. There are no significant differences between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil and inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl regarding complement activation and the release of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory interleukins. 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 participate in tumor immunology. Serum IL-12 and IL-18 levels were determined in patients with esophageal carcinoma, and the relationship between clinicopathologic factors and prognosis was investigated. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers and from 70 patients with esophageal carcinoma before curative surgery. IL-12 and IL-18 levels were determined in each serum sample by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean serum IL-12 and IL-18 levels were significantly higher in patients with esophageal carcinoma compared with healthy volunteers (P < 0.05) and mean serum IL-12 and IL-18 levels increased in patients as the pathologic stage progressed. A positive correlation was observed between serum IL-12 and IL-18 levels (P < 0.01). In patients with esophageal carcinoma, increasing serum IL-12 and IL-18 levels correlated with tumor growth and progression. The function of these two interleukin in the host immune response remains unclear. However, this part of the host immune response did not appear to contribute to the postoperative prognosis. Serum IL-12 and IL-18 levels might correlate with a certain depth of invasion and might be useful tumor markers in patients with esophageal carcinoma.

AB  - Immunotherapy has revolutionized lung cancer management and revitalized the field of tumor immunology. Anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) immunotherapy can significantly improve the survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its role in neoadjuvant therapy of local advanced NSCLC remains uncertain. Herein, we reported a case from a clinical trial of our department, a patient who achieved excellent outcome after neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemotherapy for local advanced NSCLC. A 70 years old male patient with stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma was admitted in our hospital, who initially needed to undergo pneumonectomy. After two cycles of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, the tumor significantly shrank and the patient underwent left upper lobectomy finally. The patient had grade 2 myelosuppression and recovered after injection with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. There was no operation-related complication the patient was discharged uneventfully. The patient received two cycles adjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, then immunotherapy alone monthly. The patient was well during the 4-month follow-up after surgery and would receive immunotherapy till one year after surgery. Our case added evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in local advanced NSCLC. Randomized, controlled, multi-center studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Adenocarcinoma of the human colon produce carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of a family of glycoprotein molecules that may be produced by various human cancers and, occasionally, by other abnormal tissues. The physicochemical nature and tissue distribution of CEA have been well established and a variety of radioimmunoassays have been developed for the detection of this material in the circulation of patients with CEA-producing tumours. Although the assay should not be used as a screening test for cancer of the bowel, it may serve as a helpful adjunct in the diagnosis of digestive system tumours in conjunction with other routine investigations. More important is the utilization of the radioimmunoassay for CEA under the following circumstances: 1. Preoperatively as an indicator of tumour dissemination based upon the quantitative concentrations of CEA in the circulation. 2. As an indicator of potentially curative resection manifested by a decrease in circulating concentrations of CEA to below detectable limits. 3. As an early warning of recurrent tumour growth, by detecting the reappearance of CEA in the circulation of a patient rendered CEA-negative after tumour resection, 3 months to 2 years or more before any other presently available technology can detect clinical evidence of recurrence. This last observation is now under investigation for its potential value as an indicator for second-look surgery in patients who have undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancers.

AB  - Long-term outcome of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remains poor as a result of recurrence and the emergence of drug resistance. Almost all the patients were given the same platinum-based chemotherapy after debulking surgery even though some of them are naturally resistant to the first-line chemotherapy. No method could verify this part of patients right after the surgery currently. In this study, we used 156 paraffin-embedded high-grade HGSOC specimens for immunohistochemical analysis with 37 immunology markers, and association between the expression levels of these markers and the chemoresponse were evaluated. A support vector machine (SVM)-based HGSOC prognostic classifier was then established, and was validated by a 95-patient independent cohort. The classifier was strongly predictive of chemotherapy resistance, and divided patients into low- and high-risk groups with significant differences progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This classifier may provide a potential way to predict the chemotherapy resistance of HGSOC right after the surgery, and then allow clinicians to make optimal clinical decision for those potentially chemoresistant patients. The potential clinical application of this classifier will benefit those patients with primary drug resistance.

AU  - Baars A

AB  - Surgical resection of a primary tumour is often not sufficient to cure a patient. Even when no residual cancer can be detected at time of surgery, metastases may appear in the following years, which indicates that the primary tumour had apparently spread before surgery. Following surgery, systemic chemotherapy may be used to eradicate micro-metastatic disease. Here we present two unconventional strategies that implement new insights into tumour biology and tumour immunology in the treatment of patients with cancer. Both experimental strategies use the individual characteristics of the patient's primary tumour to optimise the control of life-threatening micro-metastases. We aim to modulate the patient's adaptive immune system, targeting it towards the patient's own tumour cells to eradicate residual disease following local treatment. In one approach, this is done by autologous tumour cell vaccinations as adjuvant treatment for colon cancer patients and, in a second approach, by giving chemo-immunotherapy before local treatment to women with locally advanced breast cancer.

TI  - Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta Trap (M7824) Alone and in Combination With TriAd Vaccine and N-803 for Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Not Associated With Human Papillomavirus Infection
AU  - National Cancer Institute (NCI)
AB  - Background:  * Approximately 50% of patients with advanced, non-human papilloma virus (HPV) associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will develop locoregional or distant relapse within two years of completing definitive standard-of-care treatment. * Two ongoing clinical trials investigating neoadjuvant programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade before surgical resection of HNSCC suggest that immunotherapy can both cytoreduce existing disease before surgery and reduce the risk of locoregional or distant disease relapse after surgery. * Preliminary data from these studies suggest neoadjuvant treatments can be administered without delaying planned surgical intervention. * Experiments conducted by the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) demonstrated synergistic activity with tumor-targeted adenoviral vaccine plus bintrafusp alfa (M7824) plus Anktiva (N-803) in humanized mice bearing human carcinomas and in vitro studies. * M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap. * Adenoviral vaccines targeting known shared tumor antigens can generate antigen-specific T cells. * N-803 is an interleukin 15 (IL-15)/interleukin 15 receptor (IL-15R) alpha super agonist complex that can enhance both natural killer (NK) cell and T cell anti-tumor activity via expansion and activation. * Activity observed with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 agents alone provides rationale for testing of M7824 alone and in combination with other immune-oncologic agents that have been shown to work in concert with M7824 in preclinical studies. * Analysis of pre- and post-treatment tissues from HNSCC patients presents a unique opportunity to interrogate the effects the above treatment(s) on tumor. * A dose escalation of N-803 in combination with a flat dose of M7824 was conducted at the National Cancer Institute. Thirteen patients have been treated with the combination. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed.  Objectives:  -Determine the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) or clinical-to-pathological downstaging in patients with previously untreated intermediate/high risk, non-HPV associated, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T1-T4, N0-N3, M0 stage II, III or IV) who receive any of the three proposed treatments: M7824 alone, M7824 plus TriAd vaccine, or M7824 plus TriAd vaccine plus N803 prior to definite surgery.  Eligibility:  * Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, previously untreated intermediate/high risk, p16-negative (if oropharyngeal), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T1-T4, N0-N3, M0 stage II, III or IV) * Men or Women; Age greater than or equal to 18 years * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Office (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1  Design:  * This protocol is a sequential window of opportunity trial of Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) alone and in combination with TriAd Vaccine (ETBX-011, ETBX-051 \& ETBX-061) and N-803 for non-HPV associated resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). * Patients will be referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for this immunotherapy treatment from surrounding academic medical centers and private physicians. * Upon referral to the NIH, patients will be rapidly screened, and enrolled on the protocol, if appropriate. * This trial will enroll patients in three arms sequentially to permit safety evaluation before adding the next agent. * In the first arm of 12 patients, M7824 (1200 mg) will be administered intravenously on day 1 and 15. * If no safety concerns, accrual will proceed to the 2nd arm, and 12 patients will enroll with M7824 (1200mg; intravenous) treatment on day 1 and 15 and TriAd vaccine (5 x 10 (11) viral particles (VP; subcutaneous) treatment on day 1 only. * If no safety concerns, accrual will proceed to the 3rd arm, and 12 patients will enroll with M7824 ((1200mg; intravenous) treatment on day 1 and 15 plus TriAd vaccine (5 x 10(11) VP; subcutaneous injection) and N-803 (15mcg/kg, subcutaneously) treatment on day 1. * After obtaining pre-treatment biopsies, imaging and blood collection, patients will receive the neoadjuvant immunotherapy at the NIH Clinical Center. * Patients will then be sent back to their referring providers for their definitive standard of care surgery and adjuvant therapy as indicated based upon pathologic analysis of the surgical specimen. National Cancer Institute (NCI) investigators will have no role in directing the ensuing standard of care surgeries performed at outside institutions. * For consistency in pathologic analysis of resection specimens, tissue blocks and/or slides will be obtained from outside institutions and be reviewed by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology. * It is expected that up to 20 patients may enroll in one year. Thus, with 3 arms of 12 patients apiece, up to 36 evaluable patients may enroll. Accrual is expected to be completed within 2 years.

TI  - Adelbelimab Combination Chemotherapy in Neoadjuvant Therapy for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
AB  - According to the latest data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the new incidence of head and neck cancer in the world in 2022 will be among the top ten new incidences of cancer in the world. In the latest WHO classification of head and neck tumors, head and neck cancers include nasopharyngeal cancer, oral cavity cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, thyroid cancer, laryngeal cancer and other malignant tumors that occur in the head and neck, of which more than 90% are squamous cells cancer. Currently, the standard of care for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is surgical resection followed by risk-adapted adjuvant radiotherapy, with or without platinum-based chemotherapy, or definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. With this aggressive combination therapy, the risk of recurrence, distant metastasis, and death remains high in patients with locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC. In terms of preoperative induction chemotherapy, clinical studies have shown that patients with tumor remission after preoperative induction chemotherapy have a higher survival rate and a lower risk of distant metastasis, but the postoperative pathological complete remission rate of the tumor is lower , it is difficult to be satisfactory. With the rise of tumor immunology, more and more immunotherapy methods are applied to the clinical treatment of tumors. Current immunotherapies come in many forms, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, co-stimulatory point agonists, antigen vaccines, oncolytic virus therapy, adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) and epidermal growth factor receptor ( Epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR) targeted therapy. Among them, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely used in the clinical treatment of tumors, and the molecular mechanisms of immune checkpoints (immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs) are mainly such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Cellular antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of T cells to negatively regulate T cell-mediated immune responses; however, tumor cells utilize these inhibitory molecules to induce tumor tolerance and T cell exhaustion. Therefore, ICIs such as anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 can attach to these co-inhibitory receptors to reactivate the immune response against tumor cells. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely used clinically, among which PD-1 inhibitors are the most widely used. A clinical study (KEYNOTE-048) showed that pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy can significantly improve the survival time of recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. And this is also included in the first-line recommendation of the NCCN guidelines for the treatment of patients with recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In terms of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced HNSCC showed high objective response rate and pathological response rate. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are two ligands of PD-1. Both tumor and immune cells can express PD-L1, and PD-L1 is a useful biomarker to predict the response to PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in patients with different types of cancer. PD-L1 plays a role in inhibiting the cancer-immune cycle by binding to negative regulators of T cell activation such as PD-1 and B7.1. However, PD-L1 inhibitors are currently less used in clinical tumor treatment, mainly focusing on small cell lung cancer. Among them, adelbelimab is a human monoclonal antibody against programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and its safety has been verified to some extent. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial, the median follow-up time of the test group was 13.5 months and the placebo group was 12.8 months; the hazard ratio was 0.72 \[95% confidence interval 0.58-0.90\]; Compared with one-sided p=0.017), the median overall survival rate of the adelbelimab group was significantly improved (median 15.3 months \[95% CI 13.2-17.5\]) . In terms of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, only phase I clinical studies have confirmed the safety and tumor activity of PD-L1 inhibitors in treatment. On this basis, this study will further verify the efficacy of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with PD-L1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy.

Preclinical and clinical data indicate that efficacy of DC immunotherapy is improved when used in clinical settings of minimal residual disease, and Sipuleucel‐T is the first approved treatment based in this approach. We are exploring the efficacy of an autologous vaccine of DC loaded with self‐tumor antigens that we developed in a previous pilot trial (Alfaro, J Immunology 2011) in patients with colorectal cancer with completely resected hepatic metastasis following standard adjuvant treatment. Methods: In this randomized phase II study, patients with colorectal carcinoma with hepatic metastasis treated with complete surgical resection and standard adjuvant chemotherapy are randomized to receive DC vaccine or observation. The two‐cycle vaccination protocol includes the following strategies: (1) pretreatment with cyclophosphamide to decrease regulatory T cells; (2) maturation and activation of DC with TNF‐alpha, interferon‐alpha and poly I:C, a potent inducer of type I interferon; (3) use of autologous tumor from resected liver metastasis as antigenic source to load antigens onto DC, including antigens that are exclusive of tumor cells; and (4) administration of daily intradermal vaccines during four consecutive days in 2 cycles every 4 weeks. The strategy is to replicate the immune response induced during an acute viral infection in terms of activation signals and persistence of antigens in lymph nodes. The main objective is progression‐free survival. Thirty‐six patients will be included, allowing to detect a HR=1.75 (alpha error=0.2, beta error=0.35). Secondary objectives include assessment of toxicity, overall survival and immunologic response (in vitro lymphocyte responses against tumor antigens; delayed hypersensitivity reactions; induction of tumor antibody responses; DC activation parameters including IL‐12 and IL‐6 production and expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, B7‐H1, B7‐H4 and B7‐DC; assessment of DC maturation by expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines; and DC migration).

AB  - Background Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibition improves outcome of patients with melanoma, lung, bladder, microsatellite instability-high and other tumors[1]. However, systemic administration of immunotherapy may have limited activity in some tumors partly due to failure of activated T cells to migrate to tumor[1]. Intratumoral injections (ITI) may allow high concentration of immunostimulatory products locally while using small amounts of drugs. This may also facilitate multiple combination therapies and avoid systemic off-target toxicities. By capitalizing on existing data and experience, repurposing approved drugs for cancer represents an opportunity to rapidly advance promising therapies. Glatiramer acetate is an agent commonly used for multiple sclerosis[ 2]. It acts as an immunomodulator and has essentially no systemic bioavailability but exhibits a high prevalence of injection site reactions[2]. It upregulates the activity of natural killer cells in leukemia cell lines [3], suggesting potential for immunostimulatory effect for ITI. For percutaneously accessible tumors for which the standard of care is surgical resection without any neoadjuvant therapy, there exists a window of opportunity where ITI of glatiramer can be performed before surgery. Methods This is a proof-of-concept, investigator-initiated, window of opportunity trial in subjects with percutaneously accessible head and neck or cutaneous squamous cell cancer who are to undergo surgery. Subjects will receive glatiramer 40 mg by ITI 3 times a week prior to surgery. Subjects will receive at least one dose and up to 3 doses of glatiramer. About 10 eligible patients will be included in this trial. Safety data will be collected. Tumor tissue at the time of diagnosis and at the time of surgery will be collected and compared for biomarkers. Primary endpoint is safety. Secondary endpoint is effect of ITI of glatiramer on biomarker levels. Pre-and post-treatment tumor samples will be tested using an immunology panel that profiles immunology genes and proteins including major classes of cytokines, interferons, KIR family, and TNF-receptor. Tumors samples will also be evaluated for the Ki-67 proliferative index and for caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 immunoexpression. Paired T-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to assess the changes in the variables. We hypothesize that this approach will break the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as evidenced by an increase in inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell infiltration. Decline in Ki-67 and increase in caspase-3 may be a signal of anti-tumor activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) have increased risk of developing cancers secondary to impaired anti-tumor immunity. Treatment of patients with IEI and cancer is challenging as chemotherapy can exacerbate infectious susceptibility. However, the literature on optimal cancer treatment in the setting of IEI is sparse. OBJECTIVES: We present a patient with specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobins (SADNI), immune dysregulation (ID), and stage III ovarian carcinoma as an example of the need to modify conventional treatment in the context of malignancy, IEI, and ongoing infections. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of the patient's clinical manifestations, laboratory evaluation and treatment course. RESULTS: Our patient is a female with SADNI and ID diagnosed with stage III ovarian carcinoma at 60 years of age. Her ID accounted for antinuclear antibody positive (ANA+) mixed connective tissue diseases, polyarthralgia, autoimmune neutropenia, asthma, autoimmune thyroiditis, and Celiac disease. Due to the lack of precedent in the literature, her treatment was modified with continuous input from infectious disease, allergy/immunology and oncology specialist using a multidisciplinary approach.The patient completed debulking surgery and 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The dosing for immunoglobulin replacement therapy was increased for prophylaxis. Chemotherapy doses were lowered for all cycles preemptively for IEI. The therapy included carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and pegfilgrastim. The patient completed six-months of maintenance medication involving bevacizumab.Her treatment course was complicated by Mycobacterium avium-complex (MAC) infection, elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes attributed to excessive immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and urinary tract infection (UTI) and incontinence.Cancer genetic analysis revealed no targetable markers and primary immunodeficiency gene panel of 407 genes by Invitae was unrevealing. Lab tests revealed no evidence of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Post-chemotherapy imaging revealed no evidence of cancer for 1 year and 4 months, but the disease relapsed subsequently. The patient's lung scarring requires vigilance. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient with ovarian cancer and IEI required modified treatment and prevention of complications. In cases of IEI, optimal chemotherapy should be titrated to minimize immunosuppression yet treat cancer aggressively while decreasing the risk of infection with prophylactic antibiotics and prolonged post-treatment surveillance, including pulmonary evaluation.

TI  - Walking Affecting Immunology and Quality of Life of Breast Cancer Patients
AB  - Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing probably due to the prolonged life expectancy and a variety of environmental factors. Fortunately, breast cancer outcome and survival are improving due to early detection and new treatment modalities. After making first strides against breast cancer, i.e. undergoing ablation surgery, most breast cancer survivors still have to go through a series of chemotherapy, which could prolong their survival but almost inevitably downgrade their quality of life due to grueling side effects, such as lack of energy and vulnerability to infection. Numerous medical interventions have been tried by healthcare providers to alleviate these side effects, but some of them are expensive and therefore become another burden for the cancer-afflicted patients. Previous studies have already indicated that exercise generated long-term benefits to breast cancer survivors, including improved physical functions, elevated maximal oxygen intake, decreases in lethargic symptom, increase in both immune function and quality of life. Among a variety of exercises, walking is the least costly, easy-to-follow type. Through a simple, predesigned walking regimen, the investigators expected that the breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy could cost-effectively reap some benefit either physically or psychologically.  Cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3+), presenting at all stages of T-cell development, is a useful maker to identify T-cells. (Cluster of differentiation 4)CD4+ T cells, also known as T helper cells, play an assistant role in the immunologic process, such as maturation of B cells, activations of macrophages or cytotoxic T cells. Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T cells, known as cytotoxic T cells, responsible for destroying virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Generally, the counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells could be a reflection of immune system health. Short-Form 36(SF-36), a patient-reported survey, is a widely adopted tool to evaluate patient\'s individual health status. By means of serial blood sample collections and the delivery of SF-36 survey, this study aimed to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the effects of aerobic walking on the breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

AU  - Zhu X

AB  - Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the mainstay of malignant cancer treatments. However, with the development of immunology, the emerging immunotherapy represents a rational and alternative approach for the treatment of human cancer, including ovarian cancer (OC). Based on a body of evidence and the clinical success of immunotherapy in many malignancies, it is confirmed that blocking the programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands in OC is feasible and valid both in animal models and patients. Immunotherapy may play a significant role in the future clinical management and improve the prognosis of OC. This review will focus on the biological functions, treatment response, toxicity and viable target of PD-1 and its ligands in OC. Recognition of the multiple functions of PD-1 and its ligands in ovarian cancer will serve to deepen our understanding of the nature of OC, develop novel immunotherapy approaches and discover possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in future clinical decisions.

AB  - The surgical treatment methods for cirrhosis patients complicated with portal hypertension are complicated. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a new treatment strategy: splenic auto-transplantation and oesophageal transection anastomosis on 274 patients from three aspects: clinical observation, splenic immunology and portal dynamics. From 1979 to 2005, 274 cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension who underwent the new treatment strategy were followed up to observe different clinical indexes, which were then compared with those of the traditional surgery treatment. From 1999 to 2002, a randomized control trial (RCT) was performed on 40 patients to compare their immune function after operation. From 1994 to 2004, another RCT was carried out on 28 patients to compare the portal dynamics through three-dimensional dynamic contrast enhanced MR angiography (3D DEC MRA) investigation after operation. Among 274 patients (mean age 41.8 years), the emergency operative mortality (4.4%), selective operative mortality (2.2%), complication rate (17.9%), morbidity of hepatic encephalopathy (<1%), bleeding rate of portal hypertension gastritis (PHG) (9.1%), and morbidity of hepatic carcinoma (8%) were similar to those under traditional operation; the spleen immunology function (Tuftsin, IgM) decreased among the groups 2 months after operation. Through 3D DCE MRA, the cross section area, the velocity and volume of blood flow of main portal vein decrease significantly after operation in both groups, the auto transplantation group was significantly lower in velocity and volume of blood flow than in the control group. Splenic auto transplantation and esophageal transection anastomosis are a safe, effective, and reasonable treatment strategy for portal hypertension with varicial bleeding. It can not only correct hypersplenism but also completely stanch blood, and auto transplanted spleen in the retroperitoneal space can preserve immune function and establish abroad collateral circulation.

AB  - Homologous blood transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications. To test the clinical consequences of this apparently immunosuppressive effect of homologous blood in a controlled trial, we designed a study in which the control group deposited autologous blood before their operations for use should transfusion be needed. We enrolled 120 patients with apparently curable colorectal cancer who were able to predeposit autologous blood (haemoglobin > 12.5 g/dL). 62 patients were assigned to receive homologous blood if blood transfusions were needed during operation, and the other 58 to receive their own predeposited blood followed, if necessary, by homologous blood [corrected]. Despite the similarity between the groups in factors known to affect the risk of postoperative infections, there was a significant difference in postoperative infection rate between the homologous and autologous blood groups (17 [27%] vs 7 [12%], p < 0.05; unadjusted odds ratio 2.75 [95% CI 1.07-7.11). The rates of non-infectious complications were similar Probably because their preoperative blood depositing caused the autologous blood patients to have lower haemoglobin concentrations, they were more likely to require transfusion than were the homologous blood group (53 [91%] vs 37 [60%], p < 0.001; relative risk 1.53 [1.24-1.89]). 20 (35%) required homologous as well as autologous blood. To adjust for the many infection-related factors, we did multivariate regression analysis; tumour location, preoperative ASA index, and study group assignment were the only significant risk factors. The odds ratio for postoperative infections adjusted for these factors was 2.84 (1.02-7.98, homologous vs autologous). Testing of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses before and after surgery showed decreases in both mean diameter and number of positive reactions in recipients of homologous blood and slight increases in those who received autologous blood. This study shows the clinical potential of blood-transfusion-mediated immunomodulation, which may be important also in tumour immunology.

As 30% of patients develop PC after curative surgery, prevention of PC during cancer resection would be desirable. Regarding physiopathology of PC and intraperitoneal immunology, intraoperative application of trifunctional antibodies offers advanced opportunities for destruction of intraperitoneal tumor cells and prevention of PC. First results indicated, the intraoperative treatment with trifunctional antibodies was safe and clinically feasible. Long-term results will be available in 2010.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Racotumomab is a therapeutic vaccine based on a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody developed by the Molecular Immunology Center in Havana, Cuba, that is registered in Cuba and Argentina for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It induces a specific humoral and cellular immune response against the N-glycolyl GM3 (NeuGcGM3) ganglioside present in tumor cells, thereby provoking the death of these cells. OBJECTIVE Evaluate racotumomab vaccine use as switch maintenance and second-line therapy for patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer in routine clinical practice, outside the framework of clinical studies, and assess the overall survival, stage-specific survival and safety in these patients. METHODS A descriptive, retrospective study was carried out in patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer not suitable for surgical treatment, who received racotumomab as a part of switch maintenance or second-line treatments. Overall survival was defined from diagnosis and from the first immunization, until death. RESULTS We included 71 patients treated with racotumomab, 57.7% (41/71) of whom were in stages IIIB and IV of non-small cell lung cancer. Of the patients, 84.5% (60/71) had no adverse events, and 15.5% (11/71) had mild adverse reactions. The median overall survival was 24.5 months, calculated from the first immunization, 17.2 months for those who received racotumomab as switch maintenance and 6.8 months for patients who had progressed after the first line of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Racotumomab in routine clinical practice prolonged overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated in switch maintenance, and in stage IV patients who received the treatment as second-line therapy. The vaccine was well tolerated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated the prevalence of the unmet needs among advanced or recurrent breast cancer patients in Asian countries and little is known about the relation between their unmet needs and psychological distress/quality of life. METHODS: The participants (n = 87) comprised randomly selected ambulatory female patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer attending the Outpatient Department of Oncology, Immunology and Surgery of Nagoya City University Hospital. The patients were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires assessing the level of their physical and psychological symptoms, supportive care needs and socio-demographic and biomedical factors. The association between the patients' perceived needs and psychological distress/quality of life was then analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The patients had a mean ± standard deviation of 11 ± 7.7 and a median of 10 unmet needs. The prevalence of the 17 most frequent unmet needs was over 50%, and almost all of these unmet need items belonged to the Psychological or the Health system and information domain. The total Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey Questionnaire with cancer score was significantly associated with the indices of psychological distress and quality of life. Most of the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey Questionnaire with cancer domains except Sexuality domain were also significantly associated with all the indices of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial needs were strongly associated with psychological distress and quality of life. Quality of life and psychological distress may be improved if interventions for unmet needs, especially psychological and information needs, are made.

AB  - Ninety women with recently diagnosed stage I or stage II breast cancer who had been admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and were participating in a randomized trial were entered onto this behavioral immunology protocol. Patients were immunologically and psychosocially assessed at baseline (approximately 5 days after surgery) and again at 3 and 15 months post surgery. All of the patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years, and 60% of the patients were followed for 7 years or longer. Twenty-nine women in the study group reported disease recurrences over the entire follow-up period. Causal path modeling statistical techniques showed that natural killer (NK) cell activity was a strong predictor of disease outcome when the outcome variable was defined as recurrence v nonrecurrence of disease (chi 2 = 6.9, p less than .001). Higher NK cell activity at follow-up predicted disease-free survival over the follow-up period. When the disease outcome variable was operationally defined as time to recurrent disease, the psychosocial factors were more strongly predictive of the rate of disease progression for those who had a recurrence (chi 2 = -4.1, p less than .01), but NK cell activity was seemingly less relevant in this latter case. Overall, these findings suggest that including mood and potentially relevant immunological variables, along with important biological prognostic variables, in multivariate and prospective models such as those examined in this study, potentially contributes more to the explanation of greater outcome variance of early-stage breast cancer than has been believed in the past.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling system is frequently unbalanced in human malignancies due to increased ligand production, receptor overexpression, receptor mutations, and/or cross-talk with other receptor systems. For this reason, the EGFR is an attractive target for anticancer therapy. The epidermal growth factor also plays an important role in regulating multiple facets of cutaneous wound healing, including inflammation, wound contraction, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. In the Center of Molecular Immunology, a cancer vaccine is produced (CIMAvax® EGF) that blocks the binding of EGF to its receptor. This blockade causes a significant inverse association between the anti-EGF antibody titers and EGF concentration. Around 1,500 patients with non-small cell lung cancer have been treated, showing that this vaccine is safe, immunogenic, increases survival and improves quality of life. Taking into account the therapeutic benefits of CIMAvax® EGF vaccination and the role of EGF-EGFR system in the wound healing process, we decided to conduct a retrospective research with the aim of determining the effect to the CIMAvax® EGF vaccine on the wound healing process in patients undergoing surgical treatment. METHODS: Medical records of 452 vaccinated patients were reviewed and only six patients receiving surgical treatment were identified. Further information about these six patients was obtained from source documents, including medical records and operative reports using an observational list that included different variables. Post-surgical wound healing complications were identified using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC) version 3.0. RESULTS: None of the six patients operated on presented adverse events related to the wound healing, that is to say, no wound dehiscence, wound infection, delayed wound healing, fistula formation, abscess formation or hemorrhage/bleeding associated with surgery during treatment with CIMAvax® EGF occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of CIMAvax® EGF does not produce a deleterious effect in the wound healing process.

TI  - Trial of Adoptive T Cell Therapy With Activated P53 Specific T Cells for Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer
AU  - Alexis Ulrich, MD Prof. Dr.
AB  - Most patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) accumulate high numbers of endogenous tumor antigen specific cytotoxic and helper memory T cells in their blood. Upon appropriate reactivation, tumor antigen specific T cells can recognize and eliminate autologous tumor cells. This can be achieved ex vivo by their stimulation with antigen pulsed autologous dendritic cells in the absence of regulatory T cells. Upon adoptive transfer, specifically reactivated T cells from cancer patients can efficiently reject autologous human tumors in vivo.  A major target antigen of anti tumor effector T cells in CRC patients is p53, which is overexpressed in many colorectal cancers. Within this clinical trial, high numbers of endogenous tumor specific T cells will be harvested by leukapheresis from the blood of CRC patients harbouring p53-reactive T cells. Isolated T cells will be depleted from regulatory T cells and specifically reactivated for three days ex vivo with three synthetic long peptides containing the most immunogenic regions of p53 using autologous dendritic cells as antigen presenting cells. Activated T cells will be re-infused into the patients.  Ten patients with CRC stage UICC IV under routine first line FOLFOX 6/Bevacizumab therapy are planned to receive a singular treatment with an autologous T cell product at a dose of 5x10\^7 (first three or six patients) or 5x10\^8 (last four or seven patients) cells.  Patient treatment and follow-up will be performed at the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg. Leukapheresis will take place at the DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Württemberg-Hessen in Mannheim and generation of therapeutic cells will be performed at the GMP Unit Cellular Therapy of the DKFZ. Analysis of blood samples with respect to special immune parameters is carried out at the Immune Monitoring Laboratory, Department of Translational Immunology at the NCT, Heidelberg.  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an adoptive transfer of ex vivo reactivated p53 specific T cells obtained from peripheral blood.

TI  - Renal Mass Registry
AU  - Erik Castle, MD
AB  - RCC is a cancer that is poorly understood. The increase in both incidence and mortality rates for RCC, coupled with the lack of effective therapies for RCC beyond surgical excision, underscore the need for a better understanding of RCC tumor biology, immunology, and epidemiology. Such improved understanding could then be directly translated into new prevention strategies as well as improved patient care. Recently, the National Cancer Institute\'s Kidney Cancer Progress Review Group identified as top priorities for future research the need to better understand the mechanisms underlying known risk factors for kidney cancer; and examine tumor tissue to identify predictors of patient outcome and targets for therapy. In addition, the review group stressed that the leaders in renal cancer research over the next decade would be those institutions that could enroll large numbers of patients, collect valuable risk factor and quality of life data from these patients and harness the latest technology to organize and analyze data.

TI  - Cancer Mortality Affected by the Choice of Anesthetic Drugs?
AU  - Mats Enlund, M.D., Ph.D.
AU  - Leif Bergkvist, M.D., Ph.D.
AU  - Mats Lambe, M.D., Ph.D.
AB  - Purpose and aims By means of record-linkage, information from two registers will be merged to retrospectively examine possible associations between survival from breast-, colorectal-, or skin cancer with the choice of hypnotic used during surgical removal of the cancer.  We hypothesize that: the one- and five-year survival rate after radical breast-, colorectal- or skin cancer surgery in general anesthesia is significantly higher in patients given the intravenously administered hypnotic propofol compared with the survival in patients exposed to the inhalational hypnotic sevoflurane.  The hypothesis is based on: 1) The knowledge about the opposite effects on the immune system from the two different anesthetics and from their different genotoxic potentials 2) The well-established associations between the state of the immune system and cancer growth, and DNA damage and cancer development, with potential influences on survival.  Survey of the field Rationale and current state of knowledge A) Immuno-modulation Converging evidence from animal studies and studies of human cell-lines indicate that different anesthetics have opposite effects on the immune system. Commonly used inhalational hypnotics are in this context pro-inflammatory, whereas the intravenously administered hypnotic agent propofol is anti-inflammatory and also anti-oxidative. A few clinical studies have indicated similar effects in patients, and a recent review has suggested that \"tailoring an anesthetic plan to patient\'s needs will become increasingly critical, and immunology should help in this pursuit\".  More specifically, previous studies have investigated the immunological effects of different anesthetics on monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, t-cytotoxic cells, and t-helper cells. By affecting t-helper cells anesthetics indirectly affects the production of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-4 and -10. Anesthetics also affect the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 and -6. Moreover, the effects could be indirect by blocking or non-blocking of the surgical stress response via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. Thus, stress hormones, such as catecholamines and cortisol, mediates inhibitory effects on immune functions. In a highly complex way, the neuroendocrine system together with both pro-inflammatory- and anti-inflammatory cytokines augments their immuno-suppressive effects. Taken together, results from previous research support that inhalational hypnotics are immuno-suppressive in mice as well as in humans.  Earlier findings also indicate other adverse effects of inhalational hypnotics that could be related to immunological processes. For example, inhalational hypnotics seem to increase the occurrence of cancer metastases. These adverse effects have not been found for propofol. In contrast, propofol seem to inhibit tumor growth and reduce the tendency to induce metastases.  The research field of immuno-modulation from anesthetics was recently reviewed by Kurosawa and Kato. They concluded, that \"clinical anesthesiologists should select anesthetics and choose anesthetic methods with careful consideration of the clinical situation and the immune status of critically ill patients, in regard to long-term mortality, morbidity, and the optimal prognosis\". A key note is, that \"many in vitro investigations have elucidated the dose-dependent and time-dependent immunosuppressive effect of volatile (read inhalational) anesthetics on various immune cells\". It was stressed in another review by Meiler, \"that the perioperative process could be responsible for later adverse events\", and the necessity to \"understand the underlying biology and immunology should be particularly helpful in this pursuit\". Thus, the choice of hypnotic may affect survival after cancer surgery. More specifically, the combined effects of surgical stress and the burden of cancer and perhaps other aggravating circumstances, such as high age and malnutrition, may play a salient role in postoperative morbidity and mortality.  B) Genotoxicity Genotoxic agents may negatively affect patient\'s survival after cancer surgery, as the connection between DNA damage and cancer development is well-known. The potential genotoxicity from inhalational anesthetic agents in patients and in exposed staff in operating rooms has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. A dose-response relationship for inhalational agent exposure and DNA damage has been suggested. The techniques used, the rate of sister chromatid exchange in lymphocytes and the alkaline comet assay, as indicators of genotoxicity are well validated, and they are frequently used in other contexts. Inhalational agents seem to be consistently genotoxic, whereas the less studied propofol seems not to be so.  Project description: Retrospective, follow-up cohort study.  Patients We have in an administrative system demographic-, anesthetic-, and surgical data logged by computer available for all patients exposed to anesthesia and surgery, dated from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2009. Data includes the choice of hypnotic. All approx. 4500 patients operated on for breast-, colorectal-, or skin cancer (malignant melanoma) have been extracted from this register. Remaining demographic-, anesthetic-, and surgical data of interest will be extracted from patient\'s individual paper files. A data base will be constructed in the Statistical Program for Social Sciences, SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA). Accessible outcome data are stored at the Regional Oncologic Center in Uppsala.  Bias, especially potential major confounders, control of  1. The risk of selection bias is an inherent major disadvantage with a retrospective study. Here the risk is considered low due to the non-selective use of the hypnotics. Misclassification errors will be corrected on an individual level and important confounders identified at group level, c.f. down. 2. The distribution of different demographic characteristics between the two groups will be controlled for by the thorough survey of every individual patient file. Data on type and stage of the cancer, as well as different prognostic markers will also be included. Any unequal distribution of such confounders will be identified. Data on alcohol consumption will not be available. 3. Opioids also affect the immune system, and they will therefore theoretically constitute to be major confounders. This holds true for morphine, which we never use intra-operatively. Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, alfentanil, and remifentanil, all used by us intra-operatively, have been proven not to suppress the immune response like morphine does. On the contrary, the synthetic opioids may have positive effects in this context. We use synthetic opioids for every surgical patient at our hospital, as most other hospitals do worldwide. We have no reason to suspect an uneven administration of postoperative morphine to the two study groups, but this has also to be controlled for during data extraction. 4. Nitrous oxide, impairs the immune defense, and it also impairs DNA production by inhibition of the vitamin B12 component of methionine synthetase. Nitrous oxide will be a potential confounder for a fraction of our study population. It remains to be seen during a thorough survey of our data, if the use of nitrous oxide was evenly distributed between our two study groups? 5. Red blood cell transfusion may affect survival after cancer surgery. An immuno-suppressive effect from the allogenic material is one suggested cause. We will identify those patients having peri-operative red blood cell transfusions, control the distribution between the groups, and include them in a subgroup analysis. 6. A preceding or subsequent anesthetic given in proximity to the index procedure constitutes an important confounder and must therefore be identified. An executive decision was made defining this time span of ± 1 year from the index operation. Patients, who were anesthetized once or more than so besides the index operation within this time frame, and patients who were anesthetized from the end of the time frame to inclusion in the study will constitute separate subgroups. Accordingly, they will be analyzed separately. We assume that 10-20% of patients had another general anesthetic within the defined time interval. This assumption is based on a small pilot investigation of 100 patients in the cohort. 7. Different adjuvant cancer therapies with potent toxicity and serious side-effects will also be registered and controlled for from a confounding point of view.  Linking and matching of databases The administrative database, created as described above, will be record-linked to the regional quality registers at the Regional Oncologic Center (ROC) in Uppsala. The registers have been found to be \>97% completeness compared to the Swedish Cancer Register (SCR), to which reporting is mandatory and regulated by law. The SCR holds diagnoses only and contains no clinical information. The ROC includes a quality register for breast cancer, which was started in 1992. A register for colon cancer was started in 1995, another for melanoma was started in 1996, and one for rectal cancer was created in 1997. These registers contain information on mode of detection, histopathology, stage at diagnosis, other prognostic markers and complementary treatment given. Hence, complete oncologic- and outcome data will be available for all types of cancer included in the study within the defined period of time. Data on type and stage of the cancer, as well as different prognostic markers recorded in the oncologic registers will be extracted, as well as data on recurrences of disease, vital status and date and cause of death. The unique personal identification number will be replaced by unidentified serial numbers, to ensure anonymity for each person after data securing.  Analysis The main endpoint will be a comparison of overall survival using time to event analysis. Cumulative 1- and 5-year overall survival will be assessed using the Kaplan Meier method and the estimates will be compared between patients given sevoflurane or propofol. In a next step, Cox Proportional hazard models will be calculated to assess the risk of death adjusted for potential effect modifiers and confounders. There will also be stratifications for different types of tumors, cardio-pulmonary status, ASA-class etc. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) will be presented for all models. Subgroup analyses will be undertaken for patients having more than one anesthetic within the defined time frame; a) given the same hypnotic as during the index procedure, b) given the other hypnotic at the different occasion(s); and c) for patients having one or more anesthetics outside the defined time frame.  Statistics A clinically relevant absolute difference in five-year-survival would be 5%, e.g. a difference between 85% and 80%, the latter being an average one-year-survival for the period of interest for breast cancer, which constitutes the largest group in the study. With more than 3000 patients anesthetized with sevoflurane, and more than 1000 patients anesthetized with propofol, we will have a 95% power to detect the difference with a P-value of \<0.05, i.e. there will be a good margin for an unanticipated loss of data or ditto exclusions.  Ethics The project was accepted by the Regional Ethics Committee Jan 21, 2009 (2008/350). The retrospective approach will not create ethical considerations.  Significance Undesired effects from anesthesia on survival have strong relevance for the overall cancer treatment. Any suspicions of such a dramatic side-effect as potentially fatal immuno-modulation or genotoxicity must be investigated.  If the hypotheses are confirmed the results from the present study will be used for a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) at multiple centers to compare the two agents, and this in turn might result in a change in practice should the results be positive. If the hypothesis is ruled out, the choice between inhalation and intravenous anesthesia will not be influenced by oncological considerations, which is important to know, although it also have to be confirmed in a RCT.

TI  - Establishment of 2D and 3D Primary Cell Cultures From Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
AU  - Claudia Spies, MD, Prof
AB  - Gastric cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgery or radiation monotherapy are applicable as treatment for localized tumors, however, the majority of patients are diagnosed in an advanced disease state requiring systemic therapy Chemotherapies are non-specific, affecting healthy tissues, and the overall response rate in gastric tumors is limited. As such, there is a large unmet medical need for targeted therapies against gastric tumors. Recent advances in the field of onco-immunology unraveled the mechanisms of immune response against cancer, leading to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies such as: immune check point inhibitors (ICIs), and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), e.g. chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. ICIs and CAR T cell therapy in particular have evolved as novel therapeutic cornerstones against hematological disease, but their efficacy against solid tumors remains poor. Accordingly, a minority of gastric cancer patients show durable responses to immunotherapies and there is currently no cellular immunotherapy available for gastric cancer. Further, gastric tumors are heterogeneous due to genomic changes, cellular composition, and the microenvironment, conferring a very variable response to immunotherapies. Thus, a personalized approach is needed, in order to understand individual resistance mechanisms and to predict which patients are most suitable for which therapy.  To address this need, test systems resembling patient-specific tumor biology are required. Cell lines lack 3D context and lose their genetic fidelity through passaging. Patient-derived murine xenograft models provide 3D environment and multi-organ context, but the xeno-environment hampers reliability and translatability. The investigators envision patient-derived tumor organoids as a superior model, as they are 3D self-organizing structures which reflect the tumor complexity. In addition, they have the potential to serve as patient avatars and preclinical models to predict the efficacy of therapies.  In this study, the investigators will establish patient-derived organoids and to study individual tumor biology and as testing platforms for (immune-) therapies. The investigators further investigate the individual biology of the patients tumors and healthy tissues to not only understand the heterogeneous mechanisms of gastric cancer but also the heterogeneous mechanisms of healthy gastric tissue in the fields of infectiology and immunology.

AU  - Levine DB
AB  - In January 1925, the Board of Managers of the New York Society for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled appointed William Bradley Coley, M.D., age 63, Surgeon-in-Chief of the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled (R & C) to succeed Virgil P. Gibney who submitted his resignation the month before. It would be the first time a general surgeon held that position at the oldest orthopedic hospital in the nation, now known as Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). Coley had been on staff for 36 years and was world famous for introducing use of toxins to treat malignant tumors, particularly sarcomas. A graduate of Yale College and Harvard Medical College, Coley interned at New York Hospital and was appointed, soon after, to the staff of the New York Cancer Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) located at that time at 106th Street on the West Side of New York. With his mentor Dr. William Bull, Coley perfected the surgical treatment of hernias at R & C. He was instrumental in raising funds for his alma maters, Yale, Harvard and Memorial Hospital. His crusade in immunology as a method of treatment for malignant tumors later fell out of acceptance in the medical establishment. After his death in 1936, an attempt to revive interest in use of immunotherapy for inoperable malignancies was carried out by his daughter, Helen Coley Nauts, who pursued this objective until her death at age 93 in 2000. Coley's health deteriorated in his later years, and in 1933, he resigned as chief of Bone Tumors at Memorial Hospital and Surgeon-in-Chief at R & C, being succeeded at Ruptured and Crippled as Surgeon-in-Chief by Dr. Eugene H. Pool. William Bradley Coley died of intestinal infarction in 1936 and was buried in Sharon, Connecticut.

AU  - Minghui Zhang, PhD
AB  - According to the Annual Report of Cancer Registration in China 2014, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer have become the top 4 solid tumors with the highest morbidity and mortality rates. So far, the main treatment modalities for these tumors have been surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the effect of conventional therapy on advanced cancer is limited, tumor metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with advanced cancer. With the development of oncology and immunology in recent years, immunotherapy represents a novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer patients.  Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that present a mixed T-NK phenotype. NKT cells are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by addition of a variety of cytokines in vitro culture. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expansion of NKT cells in a clinical usage scale from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is feasible. Those expanded NKT cells exhibit antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo (tumor -bearing nude mice) against a variety of tumor cells. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of a single dose of 4X10\^9 NKT cells in mice has been proved safe.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKT cells in patients with unresectable advanced solid tumor.

TI  - Cytokine Change in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated by Thermal Ablation
AB  - Background Liver cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in the world. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths and has a global incidence of more than 840,000 new cases in 2018.1 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 75% - 85% of primary liver cancer. Hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and orthotopic liver transplantation are the main treatment options for patients with early stage HCC.2 Hepatectomy is only indicated in patients with early stage HCC and preserved liver function, whereas the application of liver transplantation is limited globally because of organ shortage. RFA is therefore the most effective treatment in patients with HCC and borderline liver function due to cirrhotic liver, especially in Asia-Pacific region where hepatitis B infection is prevalent.  Thermal ablation kills tumors via direct thermal denaturation and coagulation of tumor proteins.3 The retention of devitalized and damaged tumor cells within the body stimulates a robust inflammatory response. It has also been reported that thermal ablation creates a tumor antigen source for the generation of antitumor immunity and enhances host immune responses.4 Activated platelets release interleukin (IL) -1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and transforming growth factor , which increase vascular permeability and promote chemotaxis. Neutrophils are attracted to the ablation site and perform debris scavenging by releasing free radicals via oxidative burst mechanisms aimed at destroying inciting agents. Macrophage migration ensues, transitioning to the proliferative stage, during which macrophages secrete growth factors, including TNF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor.5 The level of proliferative activity of macrophages and lymphocytes is mediated by IL-6 positively and IL-10 negatively.6, 7 In the event of an incomplete ablation or nearly complete ablation, viable tumor cells in the sub-lethal ablation zone) may be affected positively or negatively by the concomitant inflammatory response including increased levels of cytokines and growth factors. Inflammation following ablation may have negative effects via the production of growth factors and cytokines by macrophages and lymphocytes, which could stimulate tumor cell growth within the sub-lethal zone.8 Human and animal studies using immunohistochemical staining of tissues, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of tissue lysates, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of plasma have shown significant increase in specific inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators after RFA.9, 10 The principle investigator has previously reported the inflammatory responses of RFA using the porcine liver model that the level of systemic inflammatory markers (TNF and IL-1) was significantly elevated after RFA, when compared with hepatectomy.11 Although pre-clinical studies on inflammatory responses of thermal ablation for liver tumor are substantial, clinical correlation of these micro-environmental reaction is limited in the literature. Erinjeri et al.12 reported that the ablation type and primary diagnosis predicted the change of IL-6 and patient age predicted the change of IL-10 after thermal ablation of tumors. IL-6 may act as surrogates for immunogenic cell death and the combination of immunogenic death-inducing procedures with immune check-point inhibitor may be beneficial to prolong patient survival after RFA.13 At the cellular level, RFA has proven to enhance tumor-associated antigen-specific T cell response and this contributes to the HCC recurrence-free survival of patients.14 Nonetheless, it is still not clear about the possible relationship between RFA-induced cytokines change and its prognostic value on tumor recurrence and long-term patient survival.  The principle investigator has reported the results of 209 patients receiving RFA as the sole treatment for HCC.15 The overall tumor recurrence rate was up to 80% with median follow-up of 26 months. Hence, identification of high-risk patients who might develop early recurrence using surrogate biomarkers (e.g. cytokines) carries an important clinical implication on the use of adjuvant treatment (e.g. immune check-point inhibitor).  Therefore, the investigators propose this single-center prospective study to analysis the change in serum cytokines level in patients with HCC treated by RFA or MWA. The result will be used to correlate the clinical outcome of patients, especially tumor recurrence and long-term survival outcome. This proposed clinical trial is of clinical importance in establishing the potential role of immune response as surrogate biomarkers to predict long-term patient outcome. It establishes the platform for future study of adjuvant treatment using immune check-point inhibitor for patients with HCC treated by RFA or other thermal ablative therapy. The investigators\' center is a tertiary referral center in Hong Kong managing patients with complicated hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. The number of new cases of patients with HCC managed in the investigators\' center is around 200 every year and the number of patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy is around 80 every year. All the investigators are experts with vast experience in clinical and basic researches of patients with HCC. The investigators have conducted and published several randomized trials on management of HCC and other aspects of hepatobiliary surgery in international journals.16-19  Hypothesis RFA or MWA for HCC might induce inflammatory immune response with resulting change in cytokines level. This micro-environmental reaction might positively or negatively regulate the residual tumor cells, leading to the significant changes in tumor recurrence and long-term patient survival.  Aim of study This prospective study aims to investigate the change of cytokines\' level following RFA or MWA for HCC and its clinical correlation with tumor recurrence and patients\' long-term survival data. Primary outcome measure is early tumor recurrence within one year after RFA. Secondary outcome measures are other tumor recurrence pattern (late intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis), overall survival and recurrence-free survival.  Primary outcome measure is early intrahepatic tumor recurrence within one year after RFA and MWA. Secondary outcome measures are other tumor recurrence pattern (late intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis), overall survival and recurrence-free survival.  Analysis of cytokines level using studied patient serum samples  Analytes available:  IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), TNF-α, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5  Commercially available kit:  MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel - Immunology Multiplex Assay  Application of kit:  Simultaneously analyze multiple cytokine and chemokine biomarkers with MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel - Immunology Multiplex Assay, in human serum, plasma and cell culture samples. This is an overnight incubation assay.  Expected time of study The investigators\' institution is a major tertiary referral center for HCC in Hong Kong. The patient recruitment will be started once the approval from Institution Review Board is obtained. The recruitment period is around 12 months to 18 months. With the median follow-up period of around 18 months, It is expected that the total period of study is three years.  Sample size estimation Expected number of patients to be recruited is estimated at 60 according to the past patient number undergoing treatment under the department.  Statistical analysis All data will be prospectively collected by a research assistant and computerized in a database. Statistical analysis will be performed by Chi-square test or Fisher\'s exact test, where appropriate, to compare discrete variables and Mann-Whitney U test to compare continuous variables. Cumulative survival will be computed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Log-rank test. Multivariable analysis using logistic regression model will be done to identify the independent prognostic factors affecting early tumor recurrence.  Ethical Consideration This study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association and the International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice.  Consent Written voluntary consent will be obtained after full explanation of the trial to the patient before operation and randomization.  Relevance to clinical applications  This study carries significant clinical influence on the surgical management of patient with HCC. Since hepatitis B infection is still endemic in Asia-Pacific area like Hong Kong, hepatitis B related HCC is still a burden among the whole pool of cancer patients. This study aims to establish the potential role of immune response as surrogate biomarkers to predict long-term patient outcome. It enhances the development of the platform for future study of adjuvant treatment using immune check-point inhibitor for patients with HCC treated by thermal ablative therapy.

AB  - Results of immunotherapy in childhood solid cancer have been so far, with the exception of neuroblastoma, quite disappointing. Lack of knowledge of the immune contexture of these tumors may have contributed to the failure of immunotherapies so far. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature regarding the immunology of Wilms tumor (WT), one of the most frequent pediatric solid tumors of the abdomen. In Wilms tumor patients the high cure rate of >90%, achieved by the combination of surgery and radio-chemotherapy, is at the expense of a high early and late toxicity. Moreover, treatment-resistant entities, such as diffuse anaplastic tumors or recurrent disease, still pose unsolved clinical problems. Successful immunotherapy could represent a novel and possibly less-toxic treatment option. Employing the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) method of literature search, we analyzed the current knowledge of the immunological landscape of Wilms tumors in terms of tumor microenvironment, prognostic implications of single biomarkers, and immunotherapy response.

AB  - Over the years the incidence of malignant melanoma in Poland as well as in other countries has been continuously increasing. Surgery is a treatment of choice in the early stages of primary lesions. Advanced malignant melanoma however is resistant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore there is a need for new, more effective treatments. In the last years biotherapy such as immunotherapy is focusing a lot of attention. Unfortunately, systemic administration of immunostimulatory factors is very often associated with severe side effects. Thus, concepts of specific immunotherapies such as immunogene therapy have been developed. Currently, various gene therapy strategies of malignant melanoma are being evaluated in multiple clinical trials carried out all over the world. They include gene modified cancer vaccines (GMTV) modified with genes encoding (i) cytokines or (ii) costimulatory molecules and dendritic cells modified with (iii) genes encoding tumor antigens or (iv) immunostimulatory factors. Since January 1996 in Department of Cancer Immunology USOMS, at GreatPoland Cancer Center in Poznan, Poland a GMTV has been tested in malignant melanoma patients. For the last 6 years more than 220 patients were enrolled into study of GMTV consisting of melanoma cells modified with genes encoding IL-6 and its agonistic soluble receptor (sIL-6R). More than 25% of objective clinical responses and significant life extension were observed. The encouraging results formed a basis for design of a phase III prospective, randomized clinical study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment options for patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension are complicated. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a new treatment strategy, splenic auto-transplantation and oesophageal transection anastomosis. We report results from clinical observations, splenic immune function and portal dynamics in 274 patients. METHODS: From 1979 to 2005, 274 cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension underwent the new treatment strategy, and were followed up to compare results with those patients who underwent traditional surgical treatment. From 1999 to 2002, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed on 40 patients to compare their post-operative immune function. From 1994 to 2006, another RCT enrolled 28 patients to compare portal dynamics using three-dimensional dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (3D DEC MRA) investigation post operation. RESULTS: Among 274 patients (mean age 41.8 years), the emergency operative mortality (4.4%), selective operative mortality (2.2%), complication rate (17.9%), prevalence of hepatic encephalopathy (< 1%), rate of portal hypertension gastritis (PHG) bleeding (9.1%), and morbidity of hepatic carcinoma (8%) were similar to those patients undergoing traditional operation; the spleen immunology function (Tuftsin, IgM) decreased in both groups 2 months post operation, but this decrease did not reach statistical significance. Through 3D DCE MRA, the cross sectional area and the velocity and volume of blood flow of the main portal vein decreased significantly after operation in both groups. The velocity and volume of blood flow in the auto-transplantation group was significantly lower than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic auto-transplantation and esophageal transection anastomosis is a safe, effective, and reasonable treatment strategy for patients with portal hypertension with varicial bleeding. It not only can correct hypersplenism, but may also achieve complete hemostasis. Spleens auto-transplanted into the retroperitoneal space can preserve immune function and establish broad collateral circulation.

TI  - Safety Study of Cord Blood-derived Cytokine-induced Killer Cells in Patients With Solid Tumor After Radical Resection
AU  - mingyuan wu, MD
AB  - It was estimated that 2.6 million people suffer from cancer and 1.8 million die of cancer in China yearly according to the Annual Report of Cancer Registration in China 2012. So far, the main treatment modalities for tumors have been surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, tumor relapse is still a risk for those patients underwent the conventional therapy. With the development of oncology and immunology in recent years, immunotherapy represents a novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer patients. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are a heterogeneous subset of ex-vivo expanded T lymphocytes which present a mixed T-NK phenotype and are endowed with a MHC-unrestricted antitumor activity. CIK cells are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by addition of a variety of cytokines in vitro culture.  Autologous CIK cells infusion therapy for patients with malignancies is reported world widely. However, there are several drawbacks for autologous CIK limiting its clinical application. For example, limited cell numbers, decreased cell activities, and unavailable in time etc. Cord blood, as a novel source of non-senescent lymphocytes for tumor immunotherapy, has been focused on recently. Accumulating preclinical studies have shown that cord blood-derived CIK cells are potent anti-tumor effectors using in adoptive cancer immunotherapy. However it is unclear whether administration of cord blood-derived CIK cells is safe in patients with malignancies. Our previous studies demonstrated that clinical scale expansion of CIK from cord blood is feasible. The cord blood-derived CIK cells exhibit antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo (tumor bearing nude mice) against a variety of tumor cells including ZR751, MCF7, HepG2, SMMC-7721, Hela, A375, DU145, H1299 and A549. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of a single dose of 3X10\^8 cord blood-derived CIK cells in mice is safe.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cord blood-derived CIK cells in patients with solid tumor following radical resection.

TI  - The Immune Response of Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Levobupivacaine Using Paravertebral or Superficial Chest Blocks
AU  - Ivan Ivanovski, M.D.
AB  - Introduction  The human immune system is extremely adaptable and complex. The immune response in the body is often a defense against tumors or infection and maintenance of homeostasis. It includes specific (acquired) and nonspecific (innate) immunity. The immune system is known to be shaped by a complex network of cytokines; interleukins (IL), interferons (IFN), tumor necrosis factor \[Eng. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\] etc. Tumor cells respond differently to cytokines. Certain cytokines stimulate immune reactions and are called pro-inflammatory, while others inhibit the immune system response and are called anti-inflammatory. In previous studies, Il-1, Il-6, TNFα, and IL-10 are common indicators of inflammatory changes in cancer. IL-6 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine with multiple mechanisms of antitumor activity. TNFα stimulates the production of other proinflammatory factors and proteases. IL-10 inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  Surgery and anesthesia change the activity of the immune system quickly and through various processes. Pain, fear, medications, inhalation anesthetics, opioids, tissue injury, blood transfusions, increased stress, and infection activate the immune system during the perioperative period by suppressing the adaptive immune response or enhancing the immune response.  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, second only to lung cancer in mortality. Breast cancer surgery is the primary and most effective treatment, with special emphasis on the minimal release of tumor cells into the vascular and lymphatic systems. Whether the release of tumor cells will result in clinical metastases depends primarily on the balance between antimetastatic immune activity and the ability of the tumor to metastasize to other tissues.  Regional anesthesia is a technique in which the application of a local anesthetic near a nerve or spinal cord inhibits the sensation, pain, and motor stimulation of one region of the body. Applied local anesthetics thus prevent the endocrine-metabolic response to stress. Many studies have shown that the use of neuraxial (spinal and epidural) and perineuroaxial paravertebral block (PVB) regional anesthesia in breast surgery \[(propofol / paravertebral block anesthesia - analgesia)\] improve postoperative outcome and reduce the development of perioperative immunosuppressive response associated with surgical stress.  A paravertebral block is applied to the wedge-shaped anatomical space located bilaterally paravertebral, between the parietal pleura anteriorly; vertebrae, and intervertebral discs medially; and the upper transverse rib ligament posteriorly. Pectoralis and serratus plane nerve blocks 1 and 2 (PECS 1 and 2) are newer regional anesthesia techniques in which a local anesthetic is administered between the pectoral muscle sheets. Recent research has shown that the use of PECS 2 in breast cancer surgery has the same perioperative analgesic effect as a paravertebral block, with fewer side effects. Although it has been proven that it is the blocks of these nerves that achieve satisfactory analgesia in breast surgery, their influence on the perioperative immune response has not yet been proven, nor has a comparison of the body\'s immune response to surgical stimulation with PECS 2 and PVB.  Participants  In the prospective, randomized, monocentric study, the investigators will perform a study on 100 participants, divided into two groups, or 50 participants per group. In Group 1 propofol / paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia will be used; in Group 2 the investigators will use propofol / PECS 2 anesthesia and analgesia. The investigators will include women scheduled for quadrantectomy with equilateral axillary lymphadenectomy, anesthesia preoperative status (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)) 1 and 2, aged 18 to 65 years. Exclusive criteria are patient rejection, ASA\> 3, contraindication for local anesthetic, contraindications for planned regional anesthesia and analgesia, immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids, acute infection, history of chronic opioid use, presence of autoimmune disease, obesity (defined as body mass index BMI greater than 29.9 kg/m2).  Research plan  The research will be conducted at the Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka, Department of Anesthesiology, Reanimation and Intensive Medicine, the Surgery Department, and the Department of Physiology, Immunology, and Pathophysiology at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Rijeka. The devices that will be used are ultrasound (8 Hz ultrasonic linear probe), neurostimulator needle \[22G (Stimuplex D®, B. Braun Melsungen AG)\], neurostimulator (Stimuplex HNS 12, B. Braun, Melsungen AG, Germany), a bispectral index monitoring device (BIS A-2000 BIS monitor, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA), perfusor (B. Braun\'s Perfusor®), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry device (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).  The randomization schedule will be implemented by a computer-free randomization service (Urbaniak, GC, \& Plous, S. (2013) Research Randomizer (Version 4.0)). Retrieved May 20, 2021, from http: // www. randomizer.org. Standard preoperative preparation and supervision will be performed in the ward and the pre-and post-anesthesia units. The first blood sample will be taken to all participants 1 hour before surgery on arrival at the above unit. In Group 1 the investigators will apply PVB at the thoracic (Th) level of Th2, Th3, and Th4 at a dose of 0.3ml/kg 0.5% levobupivacaine total, divided into levels. In Group 2 the investigators will apply PECS 2 block with 10 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine in the space between the large and small pectoral muscles, and 15 ml in the space between the small pectoralis muscle and the serratus anterior muscle. Both blocks will be performed with ultrasound-guided in-plane technique and neurostimulation, as described in the literature. In both groups for induction of general anesthesia, the investigators will use 1% propofol 2 - 2.5 mg/kg (10 mg/ml, Fresenius), sufentanil (Sufentanil® Altamedics) 0.2 μg / kg, rocuronium \[Zemuron®, Schering - Plow\] 0.8 mg/kg. The investigators will use a laryngeal mask (I - gel supraglottic airway) of appropriate sizes for airway maintenance. All subjects will be ventilated by controlled mechanical ventilation with a volume of 8 ml/kg, a frequency of about 12 breaths per min with a mixture of oxygen and air in a 40: 60% ratio. Maintenance of anesthesia and sedation in group 1 will be performed with continuous infusion of 1% propofol (10 mg/ml, Fresenius) (25 - 150 mcg/kg/min) and rocuronium \[Zemuron®, Schering - Plow\] 0.01 mg/kg/min via perfusor. After induction, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and BIS values will be recorded every five minutes for the duration of the operation. Continuous infusion of 1% propofol (10 mg/ml, Fresenius) will be adjusted according to the target values of BIS devices in the range of 45 to 55.  At the end of the operation, the investigators will wake up the participants from anesthesia. Postoperatively, participants will be monitored in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) room where vital parameters (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure measurement, and saturation) and visual analgesic scale (VAS) \[from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) according to Rawal will be notified. If pain with VAS\> 3 is present, participants will receive diclofenac sodium (Voltaren®, Pliva) 75 mg i.v. in 100 ml of saline for 15min. If pain with VAS ≥ 6 is present, a combination of diclofenac sodium (Voltaren®, Pliva) 75 mg i.v. and tramal (Tramal® Stada) 100 mg in 500 ml saline will be obtained. In case of nausea and vomiting as assessed on a three-point scale (0 = no nausea and vomiting; 1 = nausea, no vomiting; 2 = vomiting with or without nausea) thietylperazine (Torecan®, Krka) will be administered in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg on a scale ≥1. If all vital parameters are satisfactory and there are no complications, the participants will be referred to the department after two hours postoperatively. There, non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring (pressure, ECG, heart rate, saturation) will be performed until the block resolution. During the first 24 hours, the recovery of patients will be monitored and VAS will be assessed every 3 hours. Appropriate analgesic measures (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid analgesics) will be performed based on VAS values.  Venous blood samples will be collected 24 and 48 hours after surgery. All samples will be delivered to the laboratory on the same day where they will be processed and stored at -20 Cs until analysis. According to the manufacturer\'s instructions, serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines Il-1, Il-6, TNFα, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 will be analyzed using an ELISA test. Subpopulations of T lymphocytes (helper and cytotoxic), B lymphocytes, NK, and NKT cells will be analyzed and determined from the samples by flow cytometry. Serum subpopulations of Treg (FITC-CD4, APC-CD25, and PE-Foxp3 positive) in serum will also be determined according to the manufacturer\'s instructions.  Statistics  The group size was obtained by power analysis. Using Fisher\'s exact test, according to the paper by Deegan CA, Murray D, Doran P, et al. Anesthetic technique and the cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase response to primary breast cancer surgery. Reg Anesth. Pain Med. 2010; 35: 490-5; the expected difference in the share of interleukin level increase of at least 25% (expected increase in group 1 of 30% and group 2 of 5%) is assumed. For a test power of 85%, a significance level of α = 0.05, and an equal number of subjects in groups, at least 45 subjects per group should be included in the study. Power analysis was performed using MedCalcStatistical Software version 19.0.3 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium; https://www.medcalc.org; 2019) and G \* Power for Windows version 3.1.9.2.  IBM SPSS Statistics, version 21.0 (www.spss.com) will be used in the data analysis.  The data will be presented in tables and graphs. An analysis of the normality of data distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) will be made, and according to the obtained results, appropriate data display methods and parametric and/or non-parametric statistical methods will be applied. Quantitative data will be presented through ranges, arithmetic means, and standard deviations i.e., median and interquartile ranges in cases of nonparametric distribution. Category data will be presented through absolute frequencies and associated shares.  Differences between individual measurements will be analyzed by observing the variance for repeated measurements, i.e. the Friedman test. Differences in individual measurement times will be analyzed by the independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in categorical values will be analyzed by Fisher\'s exact test. An appropriate regression model will assess the effect of selected clinical variables on differences between study groups. All P values less than 0.05 will be considered significant.

AB  - Background: Patients with bone metastases from solid tumors often have additional treatment with bone targeted agents (BTAs) to avoid symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) such as clinically significant pathological fracture, radiation therapy to the bone, surgery to the bone, or spinal cord compression. The absolute value of BTA treatment in the era of immunotherapy (IO) is unknown. Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with IO within the Alpine Tumor Immunology Registry were compared based on whether they received an additional BTA such as denosumab or zoledronic acid. The primary endpoint was time to first SSE. Continuous data were summarized as median and range, categorical data using frequency counts and percentages. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe and visualize the effect of categorical variables. Results: One hundred and ninety-seven patients with bone metastases and treatment with IO such as nivolumab (48%), pembrolizumab (40%), atezolizumab (12%), ipilimumab (9%) and other IO (5%) were included. The most frequent tumor types were lung cancer (50%), malignant melanoma (11%), renal cell cancer (10%) and bladder cancer (9%), respectively. One hundred and twenty-two patients (62%) received a BTA treatment (91% denosumab). The median treatment duration of a BTA was 178 days (min: 1 day, max: 2010 days). Out of the 197 patients, 47 (24%) experienced at least one SSE, 100 (51%) had bone pain. Ten of the 122 patients (8%) receiving a BTA developed osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The percentage of patients without an SSE at fixed time points was higher if treated with a BTA (e.g., at 6 months, 92% [95% CI: 84% - 96%] versus 88% [95% CI: 77% - 94%]), but no significant difference in time to first SSE (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.34-1.39, log-rank p=0.29) or time to first bone pain (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.51 – 1.43, p = 0.54) between these two groups could be detected. There were marginal differences in OS between patients treated with a BTA and patients not treated with a BTA (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.01 - 2.10, p = 0.043). Conclusion: No significant difference in time to first SSE or bone pain was observed between patients who have received a BTA or not when treated with IO. Based on these retrospective results the indication of BTAs in cancer patients under treatment with IO must be challenged.

TI  - HIFU Ablation of Soft Tissue Sarcoma
AU  - Paul C Lyon, FRCR, DPhil
AB  - Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, nerves, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments. Sarcoma accounts for 1% of all cancer diagnoses; around 3,300 people are diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) each year in the UK. The incidence of STS is unusual for cancer in that a relatively large proportion can occur in children and young adults, with 9% of cases in the under 30-year group and only 43% of cases in the 65 and over group. Whilst STS is rare, it remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Prognosis is typically poor, with a five-year overall survival of approximately 54%.  The Oxford Bone and Soft Tissue Tumour Service at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, is a nationally approved tertiary referral centre for the treatment of soft tissue and primary bone sarcomas, receiving 400 new patient referrals annually. These patients are currently treated via a multidisciplinary approach involving expert radiologists, surgeons, clinical oncologists and histopathologists.  At our centre, patients with smaller (\<5cm) STS proceed directly to surgical resection; this provides a low-risk opportunity to evaluate safety, feasibility and efficacy of novel pre-operative non-ionising ablative technologies, such as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). Patients with larger (\>5cm) resectable STS currently receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy within six weeks of surgery, in line with national guidelines (Dangoor, 2016). Upon recurrence within the radiotherapy field (in-field recurrence), radiotherapy has high morbidity, including complications such as poor wound healing and infection (Tsagozis, 2018), and is not indicated prior to further surgical resection. Thus, in resectable cases of in-field recurrence, there is further opportunity to evaluate non-invasive HIFU, anticipated to both reduce tumour size and tumour vascularity, facilitating subsequent surgical resection. Furthermore, recurrent STS or metastatic STS not suitable for surgery have limited treatment options, and if not suitable for further chemo- or radio-therapy, HIFU may provide an alternative treatment option before palliation.  HIFU is a versatile treatment modality capable of destruction of tumours by focusing ultrasound waves from outside the body, usually through the medium of water, to cause ablation at a precise anatomical location.  It has demonstrated an impressive safety profile by virtue of being both non-invasive and lacking radiation, leading to FDA approvals for several indications including pain relief in bone metastases (Scipione, 2018) and uterine fibroids. Previous studies using an ultrasound-guided therapeutic device in China have demonstrated that HIFU is a successful treatment modality for soft tissue sarcoma (Yu, 2019), but this treatment has currently not been widely investigated within the UK\'s health care setting.  The University of Oxford and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust have extensive clinical HIFU experience. The first extracorporeal HIFU device in Europe was used for a study performed at the Churchill Hospital between 2002 and 2004 (Illing, 2005). The study used an ultrasound-guided HIFU system (Model-JC Tumour Therapy System, HAIFU Technology Company Ltd, Chongqing, China) to treat 30 patients with tumour deposits in the kidney or liver and demonstrated both safety and efficacy. This was followed by a non-randomised Phase II clinical trial of HIFU ablation of liver tumours (Leslie, 2008), which compared radiological response against histological findings and again demonstrated safety and feasibility for non-invasive treatment of solid tumour deposits. These studies have led to CE-marking of the JC and JC-200 treatment devices for non-invasive treatment of solid tumours such as liver cancer, kidney tumours, breast cancer, bone tumours, pancreatic tumours and uterine fibroids, based on previous clinical trials at our unit (Lyon, 2019), the latter indication recently receiving NICE approval for US-guided HIFU ablation.  Safety and efficacy of HIFU has already been demonstrated for sacral chordoma in our institution (Gillies, 2016). Due to the highly targeted capabilities of HIFU, whilst leaving superficial skin and pre-focal tissues unharmed, the ablative technology may have a role in treating local recurrence following previous neoadjuvant radiotherapy. For example, following recurrence, HIFU may be able to facilitate conversion from amputation for local control to limb salvage surgery.  Desmoid tumours are a relatively poorly understood subtype of STS which are benign and do not metastasise. However, this tumour subtype demonstrates characteristics of aggressive fibromatosis and comes with significant morbidity and mortality due to their locally invasive nature and, in the familial form, typical bowel involvement. Treatment options are limited and poorly evaluated; mortality is 34% in patients undergoing surgery for intra-abdominal desmoid and post-resection recurrence rates for abdominal wall and intra-abdominal desmoids are 41% and 71% respectively (Sturt, 2006). By virtue of not disrupting the tissue planes, promoting further fibromatosis, HIFU has previously been used on desmoid tumours in small case series outside the UK and have demonstrated encouraging outcomes for both extra- and intra-abdominal desmoid tumours (Shi, 2016), (Ghanouni, 2017).  HIFU is an attractive treatment modality for these indications due to its excellent safety profile, versatility in treating a range of tumour locations (Shim, 2016), its capability to treat multiple smaller tumours in a single session and, furthermore, being repeatable due to the lack of ionising radiation. Oxford has over two-decades of world-class expertise in clinical HIFU with published experiences in translational research of many benign and malignant solid tumour subtypes (Iling, 2005), (Lyon, 2019), (Gilies, 2016), (Leslie, 2012), (Lyon, 2018), (Wu, 2004), (Kennedy, 2004). As the Chinese JC200 device used in Oxford uses diagnostic ultrasound through a water bath to target tumours, rather than an integrated MRI tunnel, treatment of tumours at a variety of anatomical locations becomes both more practical and financially economical.  The clinical HIFU service is complimented by an extensive pre-clinical therapeutic ultrasound research facility at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford. This laboratory has provided expertise in treatment planning for a previous HIFU clinical trial using patient specific models which employ CT data (Gray, 2019). The multidisciplinary team of co-investigators and other researchers in Oxford have world-class expertise in academic and musculoskeletal radiology, sarcoma surgery, sarcoma radiotherapy and oncology, clinical histopathology and immunology.  Thus, in Oxford there is a unique opportunity to explore the utility of preoperative HIFU in the ablation of infield recurrent STS, smaller STS and desmoid tumours as a pilot study. The primary outcome measure of the study will be safety and feasibility. Radiological response will be explored as a secondary endpoints of efficacy using cross sectional (MRI) and functional imaging (18F-FDG PET), incorporating both size, perfusion and metabolic activity. In addition, novel MRI sequences (DWI including whole body MRI, CEST) may also be explored with the academic radiology department, which pose minimal addition risk to the patient (Chetan, 2019), (Schmidt, 2009).  Crucially, post-resection histology will permit histopathological correlation, mitigating against the possibility of falsely reassuring radiological evaluations (false positive complete ablations). Tertiary endpoints will explore immune response, which HIFU has been demonstrated to mediate (Wu 2004), (Wu, 2016), both through circulating blood markers and immunohistochemistry. This is of importance, as whilst this study may demonstrate safe and effective ablation of targeted STS tumours, there may be micro-metastases or known metastases elsewhere which may limit the overall survival. Thus, thorough understanding of the immune mechanisms at play during HIFU ablation may inform future complimentary systemic treatments. Whilst one other centre has recently published early HIFU experience in STS \[6\], we believe our proposed study will be the first to elucidate immune mechanisms in HIFU-ablation of STS, and the first trial of HIFU for STS in Europe.  Pain scores and quality of life metrics will also be captured both pre- and post-HIFU and this qualitative data can be used to demonstrate that the HIFU procedure was acceptable to the patient.

AU  - Lewis V
AU  - Lockey RF
AU  - Padhya TA
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We describe a cohort of patients with an unusual presentation of stridor, their evaluation and management, and their outcome. We review the pertinent English-language literature. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the records of 12 adolescent patients treated for acute-onset inspiratory stridor at the Departments of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Allergy and Immunology at the University of South Florida and the Department of Speech Pathology at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute. Two additional patients received treatment elsewhere. Demographic, historical, and laboratory data, physical examination findings, and follow-up information were extracted. A review of both the Hillsborough County Department of Health epidemiological report and the English-language literature was performed. RESULTS: Fourteen female patients who attended a local high school developed audible inspiratory noise. Twelve of the 14 were seen at the University of South Florida Ear, Nose and Throat Center. The remaining 2 patients were evaluated by outside otolaryngologists but were included in all reports from the Department of Health. Environmental studies did not find noxious chemical or biological agents in the students' environments to explain the development of the symptoms. Physical and videostroboscopic examination identified two distinct laryngeal findings causing the audible stridor. One involved paradoxical vocal fold movement, and the other, supraglottic mucosal collapse into the airway. All patients underwent rigorous speech pathology intervention and structured treatment with either complete resolution or significant improvement, seen both clinically and on videostroboscopic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Audible stridor can arise from numerous disease processes. In the vast majority of presentations it occurs sporadically and on an individual basis. Our cohort is especially unusual because of the sheer number of patients. Our presentation of a case of mass psychogenic illness as the cause of vocal cord dysfunction with additional findings of laryngomalacia within a group of adolescent girls is the first in the English-language literature. The key to the diagnosis is recognition of the disorder and susceptible individuals by using a thorough physical examination with emphasis on the laryngoscopic and videostroboscopic findings. The systematic approach, undertaken by a team including an otolaryngologist, an allergist, a speech pathologist, and an epidemiologist, proved to be effective in the management of this complex disorder and highly unusual situation.

TI  - Study of DC Vaccination Against Glioblastoma
AU  - Liangfu Zhou, M.D.
AB  - Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment (surgery +radiation +chemotherapy), median survival for patients with newly diagnosed brain glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is about one year, for recurrent GBM is about 4 months. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel treatment strategy for glioma with improving patient survival. Usually, processed tumor antigens from the patient\'s own tumor or a peptide vaccine is capable of producing an anti-glioma response. Our previous experiment revealed that the CD133+ tumor stem-like cells associated antigens could elicit highly intensive immune response against human malignant glioma , and in phase I study, we have confirmed that DC vaccine loaded with glioma stem-like cells associated antigens against malignant glioma in recurrent patients was of safety .  Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each patient. Stem-like cells associated antigens (SAA) will be prepared with glioma stem-like cells that are harvested from patients with GBM and primary cultured and sorted flowcytometrically and then irradiated. Approximately 4 weeks will be required for vaccine production and the first vaccine administration. Each patient will receive an injection of DCs at his/her assigned dose once every week during the first 6 week. The dose of DCs is defined as 8\~10×10\^6.  Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately, at the present time the majority of clinical trials were in phase I that illustrated the safety. The efficacy of DCs against glioblastoma is still lack of sufficient randomized phase II study. According to our previous phase I study, here we designed this clinical trial in a triple-blind randomized manner to validate the efficacy of DCs vaccination.  Recently，an exploratory randomized phase II clinical trial have been completed （Cancer immunology \&immunotheapy ，2018，1677，1677-1688 ； PubMed ID: 30159779）， 43 GBM patients were randomized after surgery at a 1:1 ratio to receive either DCV (n = 22) or normal saline placebo (n = 21). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analysed. Participants were stratified into different molecular subgroups based on the mutation (MT) status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Plasma cytokine levels, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte numbers and immune co-inhibitory molecules PD-L1 and B7-H4 were also assessed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that DCV treatment significantly prolonged OS (p = 0.02) after adjusting for IDH1 and TERT promoter MT and B7-H4 expression, primary vs recurrent GBM. Among IDH1wild type (WT) TERTMT patients, DCV treatment significantly prolonged OS (p \< 0.01) and PFS (p = 0.03) and increased plasma levels of cytokines CCL22 and IFN-γ compared with placebo. Patients with low B7-H4 expression showed significantly prolonged OS (p = 0.02) after DCV treatment.  In the present study, IDH1WTTERTMT subgroups of GBM patients more responsive to GSC DCV-based specific active-immunotherapy. However，It is noted that IDH1WTTERTMTGBM patients was analysed in a cohort samples which are not randomlized and the present study population is too small to evaluate conclusively demographic criteria for entry and patient recruitment. the results of the present study should be confirmed in a random cohort of IDH1WTTERTMT GBM patients. Accordingly , we made some modifications to the original plan, and are currently recruiting new participants.

TI  - Fetal tissue/organ transplant in HLA-randomized adult vascular subcutaneous axillary folds: preliminary report of 14 patients.
AU  - Bhattacharya N
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the year 1902, the first successful experimental organ transplant, i.e., an autotransplant of a dog's kidney from its normal position to the vessels of the neck, which resulted in some urine flow, was performed in the Vienna Physiology Institute under the direction of Hofrath Exner by Dr. Emerich Ullman (1861-1937). Since then, the art of transplant surgery has come a long way in establishing itself as an important discipline with the support disciplines of immunology, molecular biology, etc., for the restoration of a failing organ. Today there is a major discrepancy in the demand and supply of organ grafts. The aim of the present study is to see whether fetal organ and tissue, with its intrinsic advantages of hypo-antigenicity, can survive in a HLA and sex-randomized host in a surgically prepared vascular subcutaneous axillary fold, without any immunosuppressive support. We have earlier reported two cases of fetal thymic transplant, collected from consenting mothers undergoing hysterotomy and ligation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen cases were recruited for the present study after thorough informed consent and approval by the Ethical Committee of the Project. Of these, five patients were suffering from advanced cancer, three from diabetic gangrene, three from ischaemic heart disease and three from rheumatoid arthritis, liver abscess and disc prolapse. The ages of the patients varied from 39 to 82 years. Six fetal thymuses, three fetal liver tissues, three fetal cardiac tissues, one fetal pancreas and one fetal lung tissue were transplanted. All the fetuses were dissected and the selected tissues/organs were transplanted within one to three minutes after collecting them from the consenting mothers undergoing hysterotomy and ligation. The fetal tissue graft was placed in a surgically prepared subcutaneous vascular axillary fold, 2x1 cm, under local anaesthesia in the consenting adult recipient. Sequential Hb, Tc, Dc, ESR were done to see the impact of the transplant on the host system. After one month, the transplanted fetal tissue was taken out by an elliptical incision and the tissue was processed for histological staining. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: All the 14 patients tolerated the transplant procedure well. There was no fever, intractable pain or any other specific serious side-effect justifying removal of the transplant earlier. There was no discharge from the incision site and the healing and scar were by and large normal. There was no unusual leucocytosis or lymphocytosis. The serial histological study did not suggest features of transplant rejection. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Pregnancy and neoplasm are two outstanding examples of natural tolerance to homograft. In both cases, blocking antibody has an important role in the phenomenon of immunotolerance. From our experiments mentioned above transplantation and our earlier reported studies, we believe that the hypo-antigenic fetal tissue has distinct advantages over adult tissue for transplant purposes.

TI  - Definition of the Status of the Human Lung Stem Cell Niches ex Vivo in Tissue Biopsies Performed in Patients With Emphysema and Interstitial Fibrosis
AB  - Scientific Background  Degenerative lung disorders are the result of inflammatory events that end in destruction of the normal pulmonary architecture. Two main patterns exist:  1. Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Until 2020 it is expected to become the third cause of mortality following cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Emphysema is the destructive form of COPD as the alveolated tissue disappears. This anatomic pattern is not always homogenous and functional impairment is not connected to the extent of the tissue destruction. Therapeutic elimination of the destroyed tissue may be achieved by surgery or by using various blocking techniques (Lung Volume Reduction). 2. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by abnormal repair of the respiratory epithelium. Various diseases may result in PF such as infections, autoimmune (connective tissue disorders), sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pneumoconiosis, histiocytosis X, lymphangioleiomyomatosis LAM etc. In many situations a cause effect relationship cannot be identified and the disease is idiopathic IPF.  During the last years cell based therapies using progenitor cells and various scaffolds became available in various medical fields. Lung regenerative medicine appears to be an alternative to transplantation in these end-stage diseases.  However, very complex cellular composition of the lung, comprising more than 40 different cell types, makes this objective challenging. The epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, composed of conducting and respiratory parts, varies along its proximo-distal axis. The conducting airways from the trachea to bronchioles of human lungs consist of pseudostratified epithelium, comprising equal proportions of basal cells, secretory cells, and ciliated cells, as well as some neuroendocrine cells. The smallest bronchioles, known as terminal and respiratory bronchioles, are lined with a simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium containing secretory and ciliated cells with fewer basal cells. The epithelia of these conducting airways form a tight barrier against the outside world and are specialized for the process of mucociliary clearance. The alveoli are lined by type 1 and 2 alveolar epithelial cells, called AT1 and AT2, respectively, hereafter. These cells are also specialized for barrier function and the extremely thin AEC1s share a basement membrane with the surrounding network of pulmonary capillaries to facilitate the diffusion of gases between the atmosphere and the circulation.  This general distribution of epithelial cell types is conserved between humans and model organisms such as rodents. However, there are notable differences. For example, the transition from a pseudostratified to columnar epithelium occurs more proximally in rodents, so only the trachea and mainstem bronchi are lined with a pseudostratified epithelium. Nearly all intralobar airways in mice are lined with a simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium with few basal cells. In mice, the abrupt transition from a conducting airway to the alveoli is known as a broncho-alveolar duct junction. In humans, terminal bronchioles give rise to respiratory bronchioles from which many alveolar ducts terminate ultimately in alveoli. Considering essential role of epithelial compartment in the lung much effort has been done to identify epithelial stem and progenitor cells responsible for regenerative and reparative functions.  Epithelial progenitors reside in unique microenvironment or niches, represented by vascular and mesenchymal cells, which are richly innervated. This architecture highly resembles HSM niches.  Considerable progress has been made in mice toward identifying the signals that regulate lung epithelial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. These include Notch, Hippo/Yap, ROS/Nrf2, EGF, FGF, c-myb, and cytokines including IL-4, -13 and -6. Neighboring epithelial cells, stromal cells (including mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelium) and immune cells all represent potential sources for these factors. Distinct stem cell niches have been defined in adult mouse trachea and lung in the steady state and there is increasing evidence that in different pathological conditions stem cell niches are affected and altered.  Very little is known about stem cells and stem cell niches in human adult lung and the signals which regulate maintenance of the lung tissue homeostasis in health and disease.  Recently, the Reisner group at the Weizmann Institute has demonstrated that vacating the lung stem cell niches is a pre-requisite for successful transplantation of mouse or human lung progenitors (Nature Medicine 2015). To that end, they used an initial lung injury with naphthalene which triggered an immediate stimulation of endogenous progenitors. Thus within 48 hours the dividing progenitors could be effectively ablated by 6 Gy total body irradiation enabling effective engraftment of donor lung progenitors (Fig.1).  Fig. 1: Engraftment and functional repair of injured lungs by mouse embryonic lung cells. Following lung injury with NA and conditioning with 6Gy TBI, C57BL/6 adult mice were transplanted with syngeneic E16 stage embryonic lung cells from GFP+ donors.

Values are means ± SEM of 10-15 (n=15 control, n=10 injured and n=10 treated) mice in each group pooled from two independent experiments However, while this conditioning was required for enabling effective engraftment of donor lung progenitors in normal mice, we envision that in patients with different lung diseases, the lung niches could be already partially depleted and therefore transplantation might require less severe conditioning.  Objective To characterize stem cell compartments in their niches in different clinical situations (non-diseased compared to emphysematous and fibrotic pulmonary tissue) and to assess their proliferative and developmental properties in vitro.  To further implement lung organoid culture system in the drug screening and development of patient personalized medicine.  Methods Biopsies of lung tissue will be obtained by surgical procedures: open lung biopsies. This procedure is routinely performed for histological diagnosis of fibrotic diseases. Patients with emphysema and end stage fibrotic disease are at higher risk to develop lung cancer. A large proportion of surgically treated lung cancer patients have emphysema and fibrotic disease as histologic background. Lobectomy and pneumonectomy are frequently performed as state of the art procedures in lung cancer surgical management. Part of the resected lung tissue contain emphysematous and fibrotic changes or make look macroscopically and microscopically normal. These \"non-cancerous\" areas will be sampled and preserved at the Sheba Tissue Bank for evaluation together with samples from fibrotic and emphysematous areas. The biopsies will be analyzed by immunohistology, FACS and 3D organoids (after the removal of fibroblasts) at the immunology laboratory at Weizmann Institute.  All Samples will be collected following informed consent signatures of patients both on the designated informed consent form for this protocol and the tissue bank form. We may have as many as 3-4 patients/ week. Collected samples will be resected by experienced personnel either from the Thoracic Surgery Department or the Pathology Department (as part of their job description in the Tissue Bank). Fresh samples will be transported to the Weizmann institute for FACS and IHC.  As very limited knowledge exists on human lung tissues it will be mandatory to test lung tissues from healthy and diseased lungs. Initially we suggest testing 10-15 normal lung tissues and 15-20 diseased samples during the period of 2 years. As mentioned before the normal lung tissues will be obtained as \"non-cancerous\" areas from patients undergoing lobectomies/pneumonectomies.

TI  - Precision Diagnostics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Cellular Therapy and Transplantation (The PREDICT Trial)
AU  - Leslie Kean, MD, PhD
AB  - Hypotheses:  Hypothesis #1: The Investigators hypothesize that they can define the molecular mechanisms responsible for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute GVHD and differentiate it from other inflammatory disorders by using advanced immunologic analysis including flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptomics.  Hypothesis #2: The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based immunologic analysis will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular evolution of IBD as well as acute and chronic GVHD as well post-transplant defects in protective immunity, and determine which pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical disease. The discovery of these pathways will lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and treatment approaches, and to personalized therapeutic decision-making for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).  Hypothesis #3: We hypothesize that we can define the molecular mechanisms, phenotypic and functional immunologic characteristics involved in distinct determinants of adoptive cellular therapies, including the efficacy, longevity and toxicity associated with cellular therapy. Longitudinal characterization of cellular therapeutics and the endogenous immune response they elicit using advanced immunologic analysis including flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, TCR deep sequencing and single-cell transcriptomics will allow identification and distinction of pathways critical for efficacy and toxicity and enable subsequent therapeutic modulation.  Hypothesis #4: We hypothesize that differences in the gut microbiome of patients with IBD and recipients of HCT play a major role in disease severity and overall clinical outcomes in both diseases (e.g. bacteremia, unexplained fevers, mortality). The longitudinal characterization of the gut microbial communities by next generation sequencing will allow for detection of sequential microbial changes that coincide with observed clinical changes. the discovery of significant changes in the microbiome that are repeatedly observed with a particular clinical outcome will lead to better mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology and inform future diagnostic and preventive approaches.  Hypothesis #5: We hypothesize that immune dysregulation associated with a wide range of disorders will alter the immune response to vaccines, compounding susceptibility to infectious diseases in these populations. Specifically, HCT and solid organ transplant recipients, as well as patients with active or recent history of malignancy, or autoimmune diseases may have reduced T and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination due to the effect of disease pathophysiology or treatment regimens on immune function. Comprehensive serologic analysis, high parameter flow cytometry, and T and B cell RNA sequencing will enable longitudinal analysis of neutralizing antibody titers and antigen-specific T and B cell expansion, phenotype, diversity, and survival following vaccination in these patient populations, as well as in related and unrelated healthy controls. These data will provide mechanistic insight into how immune impairment in these disorders contributes to poor responses to infections. as SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen to which much of the population remains naïve, this represents a unique opportunity to study the immune response to a novel challenge in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, these findings will inform public health guidelines on how to improve measures to protect vulnerable populations from preventable disease.  Aims:  Specific Aim #1: To identify the mechanisms specific for IBD and GI acute GVHD and delineate it from other inflammatory disorders.  Objective 1: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis on T cells purified from GI tissue samples taken from patients who undergo endoscopy for presumed GI GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional gastrointestinal disease (FGID).  Objective 2: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptome analysis on T cells from the peripheral blood at the time of endoscopy in patients diagnosed with GI GVHD, IBD, and FGID.  Specific Aim #2: Characterize the immunologic dysregulation responsible for IBD, acute GVHD, chronic GVHD and defects in protective immunity in patients undergoing HCT.  Objective 1: Perform longitudinal immune analysis on T cells and B cells purified from patients with IBD and those undergoing allogeneic HCT. For transplant patients, we will compare T and B cell immunity in patients who develop acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, and infectious complications post-transplant and compare to patients without these complications.  Objective 2: Perform microbiome analysis longitudinally in patients with IBD and those undergoing HCT to determine the impact of microbiome alterations in the development of post-transplant complications.  Specific Aim #3: Identify the molecular and cellular immunologic mechanisms involved in determining the clinical response to cellular therapies and distinguish pathways critical to a successful anti-tumor response from those involved in adverse effects.  Objective 1: Characterize the cellular product prior to administration and track its distribution, kinetics, persistence and function longitudinally in vivo in the patient\'s peripheral blood and when applicable bone marrow, CSF and other tissues, using qPCR-based transgene detection (if applicable), flow cytometry, mass cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis on T cells and other immune cells contained in the cellular product.  Objective 2: Longitudinally interrogate the interplay of the cellular therapy with the endogenous immune system and delineate the role of the endogenous immune response in the efficacy, persistence and toxicity of cellular therapy, using flow cytometry, mass cytometry, TCR deep sequencing, whole transcriptome analysis on endogenous immune cells and analysis of soluble factors and antibodies.  Specific Aim #4:Characterize the antigen-specific adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with immune dysregulation due to cancer, transplantation, or autoimmune disease and identify mechanisms underlying impaired generation of durable immunity.  Objective 1: Perform comprehensive longitudinal analysis of serologic immunity pre- and post-vaccination, including to booster vaccines, in patients and healthy controls, including assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels and neutralizing antibody titers.  Objective 2: Use high parameter flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), and T and B cell repertoire analysis to characterize the longitudinal development of antigen-specific T and B cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination and subsequent booster vaccines in patients and healthy controls.  Objective 3: Assess the ability of sera and cloned antibodies from patients to respond to bind and neutralize viral variants, as compared to that of healthy controls.  Background and Significance:  IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which includes Crohn\'s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), is a chronic complex gastrointestinal (GI) autoimmune condition that inflicts 1.4 million people in the united states1. The incidence and prevalence of both CD and UC are increasing over time and encompassing larger areas of the world1,2. In addition, pediatric IBD comprises 25% of all diagnosed IBD, relegating the child to a lifetime of gastrointestinal disease and exposure to immunosuppression especially during a period meant for growth and development. Despite ongoing research into the pathogenesis and genetic abnormalities, the mechanism behind IBD development and progression is not well understood. Standard therapies still rely on steroids, other non-specific immunosuppression (such as methotrexate and azathioprine), and anti-TNF biologics. Although newer therapies such as agents that block cytokines and leukocyte trafficking are emerging, no universally successful treatments have been identified. Thus, relapsing forms of IBD continue to lead to systemic compromise in nutritional absorptive capacity, anemia, and often, to the need for surgical interventions. Deciphering the mechanisms driving the unique subtypes of IBD (even within UC and CD) then optimizing treatment based on the underlying systemic dysregulation is a critical unmet need in the field. While the underlying immune mechanism of IBD remains undetermined, there is significant data to suggest that IBD may represent an inappropriate immune response towards self antigens and commensal microbiota in a genetically susceptible host3. Thus, murine colitis models suggest that mucosal inflammation results from pathologic T helper- (Th) cell responses, along with regulatory cell defects. These data have emerged from experiments in IL-2 deficient mice4, IL-10 deficient mice5, TGF-beta6, and TGF-betaGRII dominant negative transgenic mice7. The pathogenesis also includes an exaggeration in effector cell responses, which have emerged from experiments in Stat4 transgenic mice8 and TNFARE mutant mice9. More recently human cytokine analysis suggests that despite clinical similarities, each subtype of IBD show distinctive cytokine profiles10. Although initial studies have begun to target specific effector T cell pathways11, the application of target organ transcriptomics is in its infancy and individual targetable pathways are still elusive.  HCT: Allogeneic HCT is an effective treatment for patients with malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases. However, this treatment is complicated with high rates of morbidity and mortality limiting its broader application. The leading causes of post-transplant morbidity and mortality include acute and chronic GVHD, relapse and infectious disease. The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems approach to understanding the mechanisms driving these complications, such that evidence-based treatment strategies can be devised.  Acute GVHD: Acute GVHD is mediated by donor-derived allo-reactive T cells becoming activated and resulting in cytotoxicity against host cells12,13 as well as cytokine-mediated tissue damage. Moderate to severe acute GVHD can occur in up to 60% of patients undergoing HCT and the more severe forms have been associated with mortality rates \>50%14-17. The most common sites of the immune-mediated tissue damage are the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI GVHD occurs in 40-50% of HCT patients and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality from this disease17.  The diagnosis of GI GVHD is derived from clinical and histopathological findings. GVHD can occur in both the upper and lower GI tract leading to symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia12. Histopathological diagnostic criteria for GI GVHD includes identification of crypt cell apoptosis, crypt destruction and/or mucosa denudation18. Unfortunately, the severity of GVHD on histology is poorly correlated with the clinical course of the disease.  While GI GVHD is a common complication following HCT there remain many barriers to its consistent and accurate diagnosis. First, diagnosis is dependent on appropriate tissue sampling. Visible lesions are frequently absent19 and endoscopic findings can be diffuse and nonspecific. There is also no consensus on the optimal location of the GI tract for biopsies or number of biopsies needed to secure a diagnosis. There is also frequent discordance between biopsy specimens from the upper and lower GI tract20. Second, patients presenting early in the course of GVHD may have subtle histopathological findings that may be missed or not yet present. At the onset of GVHD few apoptotic cells may be seen and crypt loss and mucosal damage may yet to have occured18. Lastly, there are also confounding factors that can lead to the misdiagnosis of GVHD that include conditioning regimen related toxicity, concomitant infections, and medications which can all cause focal inflammation of the GI tract. In the first 20 days following a myeloablative conditioning regimen diffuse apoptosis can be seen mimicking acute GVHD21. Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus infections can also have similar clinical and histopathological presentations22. Use of mycophenolate mofetil23 and proton pump inhibitors24 have also been found associated with GI tract apoptosis that can be misdiagnosed as GVHD. All of these factors lead to the high degree of inter-observer variability in the histological diagnosis of GVHD18,25 and poor correlation with the clinical observations, illustrating the need for more sensitive and specific methods of diagnosis.  There have been recent advances in the identification of biomarkers in GVHD that have diagnostic and prognostic significance. IL-8, IL-2 receptor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), elafin, regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha (reg-3alpha), TIM3, IL-6, ST2, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), IL-33, CXCL10, and CXCL11 have all been found to have utility in predicting the development of GVHD26-28. While these biomarkers have been identified they have not been extensively validated and are yet to be clinically adopted as a guide to alter treatment. Moreover, the biomarkers discovered thus far are often the result of downstream pathway perturbations and discovering the upstream dysregulation that occurs earlier in the course of the disease may be valuable in developing diagnostic or prognostic models that could lead to trials aimed at altering the natural course of the disease.  Our group has previously shown that by using advanced immunologic analysis including flow cytometry, and whole transcriptome analysis, we can identify previously unrecognized molecular pathways active in GVHD29-31. We anticipate that by utilizing a systems immunology approach in patients with acute GVHD we will be able to identify pathways that have diagnostic and prognostic value. This may enhance our diagnostic capacity and most importantly, allow us to individualize management of patients based on their specific immunologic profiles.  Chronic GVHD: CGVHD occurs in 40-60% of transplant patients32-35 with the incidence of this disease rising in the past 2 decades36 chronic GVHD causes significant mortality, and in those patients that survive, it can result in profound effects on quality of life37-40. Despite the increased frequency of chronic GVHD, accurate diagnosis and evidence-based therapy is still lacking. Thus, while chronic GVHD biomarkers have been identified there have yet to be any that qualify for clinical application41. Moreover, these biomarkers often represent end-stage pathway perturbations and may result from nonspecific inflammation and tissue damage as well as counter-regulatory mechanisms. In addition to the challenges in diagnosis, there are significant treatment challenges as well: Thus, treatment of chronic GVHD has not changed significantly over the past few decades. First line therapy remains corticosteroids with or without calcineurin inhibitiors (CNIs)42-44 and unfortunately, approximately 50% of patients will fail and require second line treatment45,46 with failure-free survival at 2 years following second-line therapy being only 25%47. These data underscore the significant unmet needs in this field, both for molecular diagnostics and evidence-based treatment paradigms.  Protective Immunity: In addition to the challenges of acute and chronic GVHD, patients undergoing HCT and those with IBD face other toxicities as well, many of which are related to dysfunctional immune reconstitution after transplant. However, although the phenomenology of the many defects in protective immunity (both against infectious pathogens and against leukemia relapse) is well-documented, the causative molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To address these questions, our group and others have begun to perform detailed assessments of immunologic reconstitution after HCT including the application of new T Cell Receptor (TCR) and B cell Receptor (BCR) deep-sequencing technologies30,48-54. These technologies allow the investigation of the breadth and depth of post-transplant immune reconstitution at a level of molecular detail not previously possible and hold the promise of deepening our understanding of the impact of infectious pathogens on global immune health and immune reconstitution. The widespread application of these technologies, and their intersection with detailed assessment of immune phenotype and function can provide novel insights about the state of immune health in transplant patients, and holds the promise of identifying patients in need of novel interventions to improve their post-transplant immune reconstitution.  The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems-biology approach to enable precision diagnostics for the key immunologic outcomes post-transplant. This approach will deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the most deadly post-transplant complications, and serve as a critical platform upon which to design evidence-based treatment paradigms for transplant patients.  Cellular Therapy: Novel adoptive cell therapies are increasingly entering clinical trials and are available as FDA approved biologics, thereby providing a therapeutic option for previously refractory patients. This broad and exciting field includes chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed against a variety of antigens55, T cells genetically modified to express TCRs56,57, cytokine-stimulated NK-cells58, as well as tumor vaccine approaches with endogenous, irradiated tumor samples59 or immune cells pulsed with tumor antigen.60 Chimeric antigen-receptor T cells have led to dramatic responses, particularly in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies61-64, leading to FDA approval of several products. While unprecedented clinical remissions can be achieved initially, the approach is frequently limited by the durability of the response and CAR T cell persistence with an EFS of 50% at 12 months after infusion61, tumor escape mechanisms65 and significant toxicity involving cytokine release syndrome, neurologic toxicity66. In the context of CAR T cell therapy, key factors for successful application have been identified and include incorporation of a costimulatory signaling mechanism67,68, association of in vivo CAR T cell expansion with response69 and contribution of T cell phenotypic subgroups with capacity to proliferate and persist long term70. Additionally, important insights into the roles of IL-6 and IL-1 in cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity71,72 and the contribution of a pan-T cell infiltrate and high cytokine levels in the CNS as mediators of neurotoxicity 73, have been gained by our group and others. However, there is a significant unmet need to apply a systematic approach interrogating the determinants of a successful response, toxicity, interaction with the endogenous immune system and short- and long-term effects of interventions aimed at reducing toxicity such as administration of the IL6R-antagonist Tocilizumab or IL-1 blockade74.  In this study we aim to systematically interrogate the characteristics of cell therapy products, evolution after administration in vivo and behavior in different compartments such as peripheral blood, bone marrow, CNS and if applicable tissues and their interplay with the endogenous immune system. Single cell transcriptomics, coupled with TCR-sequencing (when applicable BCR sequencing) and phenotypic characterization of transferred and endogenous immune cells as well as analysis of secreted immune factors such as cytokines, chemokines and antibodies in the plasma will be employed and correlated with clinical responses. This unbiased, systematic precision-diagnostic approach will allow identification of critical pathways which are common or distinct depending on the nature of the cell therapeutic approach, target and disease entities and associated or segregable from undesired toxicities. This will critically inform future rational design of cellular therapeutics and inform possible therapeutic interventions after cell therapy administration.  Vaccine Responses: A common theme among stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients, patients with current or prior malignancy, and patients with autoimmune or rheumatologic disease, including IBD, is impaired immune regulation, which is often compounded by the effect of immune-modifying treatments, including radiation, chemotherapy, and long-term immunosuppression. 15% of solid organ transplant recipients are hospitalized with a vaccine-preventable illness in the first five years after transplant in spite of measures to immunize these patients (Feldman et al., 2019), which is consistent with studies showing impaired responses to vaccines in these patients (Madan et al., 2008; Mazzone et al., 2004). HCT recipients respond to variable degrees to vaccination, but do not mount the same magnitude of response as in healthy controls, and may have further altered responses if they also have GVHD (Avetisyan et al., 2008; Shalabi et al., 2019). Patients with rheumatologic or autoimmune disease have also been shown to have impaired responses to particular vaccines, especially if on immunomodulatory agents such as TNFalpha blockade (Dell\' Era et al., 2011). Studies of childhood cancer survivors suggest that immune impairment may persist beyond disease resolution; pediatric leukemia survivors who do not receive HCT have impaired humoral and adaptive immunity at treatment completion(Perkins et al., 2017; Top et al., 2020), and some patients do not respond, and others may have waning immunity(Nilsson et al., 2002; Top et al., 2020) in spite of re-vaccination attempts. As immunization efforts against SARS-CoV-2 become widespread, insight on the vaccine response in immunocompromised patients will be critical to informing more effective strategies to protect this population from severe COVID-19, which can be extrapolated to other vaccine-preventable pathogens.  In this study we propose to use a systematic approach to longitudinally profile humoral and antigen-specific T and B cell responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with a broad range of immune-modifying diseases. Blood samples from patients will be collected prior to, and at regular intervals following, vaccination. We will assess the durability and magnitude of long-term antibody responses using isotype-specific ELISAs and neutralizing antibody assays. High-parameter flow cytometry and scRNAseq will enable high-resolution phenotyping of antigen-specific T and B cell memory cells, as well as repertoire analysis, which may impact the likelihood of immune escape in vaccinated patients. Finally, this study will allow us to determine whether cloned antibodies or serum from patients with immune dysregulation are less able to neutralize viral variants, providing insight on whether reduced clonal diversity in patients may result in less protection against viral variants.
